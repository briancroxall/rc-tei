# Romantic Circles TEI Repository

This repository collects (most of) the TEI files that underlie *Romantic Circles*'s content. We've designed this repository to make it easy for interested researchers to query the TEI directly, aggregate it into interesting corpuses, and generally use it for a range of digital humanities projects.

Our work to expose and make these resources useful is very much underway! For now, here's how we've organized this repo, and what you can expect to find here:

- The `editions`, `pedagogies-commons`, and `praxis` folders house the TEI themselves. These are organized by year. Not all content on *RC* is TEI-ed, and you can mostly expect to find content from 2013 on in this repo.
- The `_xslt` folder houses the stylesheets we use to locally transform TEI into HTML, which we then deploy to our Drupal site.
