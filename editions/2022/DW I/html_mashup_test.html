Byromania had spread amongst the literary coteries of Brazil, where, “at the University of São Paolo, everyone wanted to be like Byron” (Stephen and Jordan Hart,
        “Latin America’s Byron”
      ). In the 1940s, while in exile in Cambridge during the Spanish Civil War, Luis Cernuda looked to Percy Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> (1840) to better understand his own role in society as a poet, questioning how he might alleviate the suffering of man in the practical world. In 1972, Jorge Luis Borges sang to Keats in a sonnet invoking his Grecian urn, echoing the song of the nightingale from Keats’s 1819 ode.</p><p>It is not common to associate Latin America with studies of English Romanticism. Despite the long and influential relations between the British Empire and the countries of South and Central America, it is surprising that instead of multiple cultural bridges, there appear only a few scattered paths linking Romantic writers to the Latin American intellectual tradition. England not only played a fundamental role in the independence of countries like Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina, but also exerted a fundamental influence in the process of industrialization and modernization throughout the continent, including certain territories in Brazil. Throughout the nineteenth century, railroads in Latin America were built by British companies, industries were created under the supervision and much to the profit of English investors, and market networks were developed to facilitate the circulation of capital across the Atlantic. Similarly, waves of immigration brought considerable numbers of British citizens to settle in major developing cities, as well as in rural areas that needed to be industrially developed. How is it possible, then, that this tremendous economic, social, and political impact was not readily reflected in the Luso-Hispanic literary productions of the time?</p><p>In this volume, we examine a selection of prominent writers and works framed within the lines of British-Luso-Hispanic dialogues. In the essays that follow, Romanticist and Hispanophone scholars trace the reception of the British Romantics in Latin America and Spain through circulation, translation, and adaptation. Each of these studies highlights major obstacles that have historically impeded the transmission of English Romantic works into a language that is, for historical and geographic reasons, a very important neighbor. In many cases, the research offered by the scholars here exposes a surprising dearth in transmission—a paucity of references, or the surprisingly late date of published translations. They also challenge the assumption that Latin American nations would automatically identify with Romantic revolutionary ideals, superimposing these upon their own political contexts and paving the way for plentiful adaptations. Hispanophone authors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries do not necessarily adopt a tone of identification with English cultural or political paradigms, but, rather, engage in critical readings and creative adaptations. Despite these rich connections, the historical trajectory for Latin American afterlives of the English Romantics is one of surprising scarcity and belatedness. This collection aims to recuperate some of the research, long overdue, along this line of transatlantic and translinguistic conversation.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Comparative Romanticist studies have long privileged the languages of German, French, and Italian. British Romanticism’s indebtedness to German philosophy, literature, and art has yielded a dominant stronghold within the field; the historical impetus of the French Revolution has made French an essential area for serious comparativist work; while Shelley’s and Keats’s years in Rome have established a strong Italian connection.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

Wharram, explores comparativist studies in German, Hebrew, French, and Japanese. But of the major European languages, Spanish has received the least critical attention in reception studies.</span></div></div> Yet the critical history of the Romantics’ reception in Spanish, both in Europe and in Latin America, has not garnered serious critical attention until the last decade. Gabriel Insausti attributes this partly to the fact that “Spanish Romanticism had historically been very weak and had not left behind any noteworthy poet,” throwing Spanish writers into a condition of a “sort of late-yielding fruit” (
        “Toward Unity”
      ). This volume investigates the afterlives of British Romantic poets in the Hispanophone world with an emphasis on Latin American authors. Reframing the outdated model of a European center and a New World periphery, we ask the following questions: To what extent has translation shaped or impeded the dissemination of otherwise global Romantic texts throughout countries like Argentina, Cuba, Colombia, and Venezuela? How do Latin American reinterpretations of Romantic texts assume or elide the colonial burdens of influence from English works, as compared to those imposed by continental Spanish texts?

Almeida-Beveridge’s 2010 collection of essays, <em>Romanticism and the Anglo-Hispanic Imaginary</em>, reveals the continued presence of South and Central American culture within the British canon and the English literary imagination, particularly in the context of the Peninsular War and the Wars of Latin American Independence. These studies chart the dialogues of Latin American and Spanish intellectuals that took place in British territory during the crucial years of Latin American independence movements.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

We explore how Hispanophone writers received, reworked, and incorporated the works of the English poets into their own literary traditions. Often, these authors faced a linguistic barrier, immersing themselves in British literature while improving their English language skills through work as translators. The essays we have included analyze how Anglophone Romantic sources have been read, questioned, and adapted to their own local realities. Building upon Almeida-Beveridge’s and Saglia and Haywood’s collections that explore eighteenth- and nineteenth-century exchanges, we investigate how these interactions extend through the twentieth century and recalibrate the cultural balance between the Hispanic and the Anglophone spheres.</p><p>Featuring paired essays on Byron, Shelley, and Keats, we trace afterlives anchored around the three major second-generation poets. Their points of connection with the Luso-Hispanic world are prominent writers of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries whose intellectual curiosity and cosmopolitanism bridge the British Isles with Central and South America, as well as with Spain. The following studies compose a collection of echoes, reflections, and translations of the English Romantics in Spanish and Portuguese. The works of José Marmol, Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, Martín Zapata, Luis Cernuda, Alejo Carpentier, Jorge Luis Borges, and Julio Cortázar constitute the tiles of this multicolored mosaic.</p><p>Given the historical asymmetry of the political and historical relations between Spain, Latin America, and the British Empire, one common strand that emerges among the articles is how these authors confront questions of cultural marginality and belatedness. Contrary to the assumptions of most Anglophone readers, the theme of marginality in the Latin American afterlives of English Romantic writers is not necessarily one of Eurocentric exclusion or rejection. The Latin American works studied in these essays are defined neither by imitative idolatry nor a sense of colonial anxiety. On the contrary, they present different strategies of cultural negotiation that allow them to contest assumptions of subordination or respectful deference. The transformations of Byron, Shelley, and Keats by Hispanophone authors are marked by authority, whimsy, and adventure, often evoking a sense of playful irreverence. These authors innovatively transform the works of their predecessors through purposeful misreadings and adaptations, forging links of aesthetic closeness and poetic familiarity that compensate for their chronological separation. Major figures like Borges, Cortázar, and Carpentier also function as savvy critics of the English Romantic tradition; they conscientiously position their writings within two literary traditions with a full understanding of their historical, national, and generic repercussions. Afterlives from these perspectives help to decenter the Anglophone pillars of Romanticist study, helping to mitigate the exclusivity of a field that centers an entire literary and cultural universe within a span of fifty years on the British Isles. The various transformations of the major British Romantic poets studied in these contributions conjure up new figures with which to populate our familiar canon: an alternately dour or ethereal Byron (Mármol / Antônio Álvares de Azevedo); a more pragmatic Shelley (Cernuda); an exuberant and virile Keats (Cortázar).</p><p>Our overdue recognition of the Latin-American reception of English Romantics comes at a timely moment, particularly within the current political climate of the United States, where the rhetoric is increasingly one of insular nationalism and discrimination toward our Spanish-speaking neighbors. The imperative to “speak English!” and only English in schools and public spaces runs counter to the Romantic spirit of openness, imagination, and respect for the rights of the individual. With this volume, we wish to demonstrate the obvious: that the ability to work in neighboring languages only enriches our research in the academy and injects life into our Anglophone canon. Moreover, the work we value and make visible through publications and teaching should recognize too the fundamental role that Latin American, including Brazilian, authors played in the global production of Romantic literary legacies. This rings especially true when an increasingly diverse professoriate and graduate cohorts include many talented bilingual scholars of Latin American descent. Beginning with the content of our research, we envision an academia in which fluency in Spanish is viewed as an asset in comparative Romantic studies on an equal plane with proficiency in German, French, and Italian.</p><p>While developments in World Literature studies have called for a shift away from an assumed Anglocentrism, made evident in manifestos such as Aamar Mufti’s <em>Forget English!</em>, we suggest that these sentiments apply, ever so counterintuitively, to the field of British Romantic studies. To propose that English Romanticists might turn away from English is not an unfounded proposition. As C.C. Wharram asked in his 2014 preface,
        “Objects of Translation(s),”
       “Why do we decide in advance that ‘British’ necessarily entails the elimination of all voices not originating in British and in English?” Suh-Reen Han’s <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> volume on <em>English Romanticism in East Asia</em> answers this call, extending Romantic studies to a global scale, showcasing the skills of bilingual scholars who engage deeply in historical study and close readings in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. These essays help studies in “foreign” languages find a home under the aegis of our discipline. Special issues of <em>Studies in Romanticism</em> and <em>Romantic Circles Praxis</em> on the Black Atlantic and Black Romanticism, as well as the <em>European Romantic Review</em> issue on the
        “Literature of Abolition,”
       do the important postcolonial work of pushing British Romanticism into regions that force recognition of the most uncomfortable corners of our literary tradition (Youngquist and Pace; Youngquist and Botkin; Chander and Matthew). This courageous scholarship transcends geographic, national, and racial borders with an ear bent towards historical justice. It demonstrates that Romantic studies need not remain divorced from efforts in modernist, Americanist, and medieval literary studies to resist an exclusive and exclusionary Anglocentric impetus—that Romanticism’s privileging of the Big Six need not preclude global scholarship. We now raise this challenge to scholars who might combine the transatlantic <em>and</em> the translingual, encouraging multilingual researchers who can help locate the legacy of Romanticism today in what used to be unforeseen pockets of the globe. This collection serves as an invitation for further research into Latin American afterlives of the Romantic writers, promoting the scholarship of yet undiscovered translations, adaptations, and responses that will continue to expand the transatlantic canon.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3"><h2><span class="head">* * *</span></h2><p>The first essay of the volume begins broadly and on a celebratory note, exploring ideas of Romantic celebrity and the international circulation of personality in the southern hemisphere. In
        “Latin America’s Byron,”
       Stephen and Jordan Hart explore ways in which Latin America and English Romanticism “clashed and overlapped during the nineteenth century” in their portrayals of Lord Byron. They trace how Byronic figures were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the novelist José Mármol, who recontextualized the character of Manfred in an Argentine setting, and by the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo, who projects a Don Juan figure in his Portuguese poems. This study offers a glimpse into the fervid Byromania spreading amongst young intellectuals in the Southern Cone. Hart and Hart propose that Byron’s image was ultimately viewed in Latin America through a diversifying <em>chiaroscuro</em> effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was “luminous and ethereal,” while Brazil’s Byron was “dark and brooding.” But this influence exerted by Byron was not unidirectional. Indeed, the essay concludes by suggesting ways in which Simón Bólivar served as an inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both literary freedom and political independence.</p><p>We continue tracing Byron’s afterlives with a translation study by Juan Jesús Payán, who bypasses the more obvious Hispanic connections of <em>Don Juan</em> to focus on the lingering imprint of Byron’s Gothic valences instead.
        “Translative Vampires: Martín Zapata and the Early Fate of <em>The Giaour</em>”
       explores the often unfaithful translations of Byron’s <em>The Giaour</em> into Spanish, especially in light of their prosification and importation across genres. Focusing on a short narrative adaptation by the Argentine writer and politician Martín Zapata, Payán shows how the very choice of <em>The Giaour</em> as his source material, in the context of Argentine intellectual and political tensions, was a daring statement unto itself. Comparing this to previous renderings of Byron’s works into the Spanish language—both in Spain and in Latin America—Payán highlights the exceptionality of Zapata’s version, pointing out that the Argentine was the first to provide a direct adaptation from the original text, and also the only one to truly preserve the vampiric elements of the plot. Performing a political reading, Payán understands Zapata’s translation as an element of disruption that challenges the divisions between “Civilization” and “Barbarism” upheld by his contemporary, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento. Complicating the Orientalist paradigm because it “focalizes through the perspective of the traditional Other,” <em>El Giaur</em> (sic) shows Zapata challenging the binary categorizations of good/evil, East/West, and modernity/backwardness in the context of nineteenth-century Argentina.</p><p>We move from translation to adaptation in Omar F. Miranda’s
        “<em>Prometeo Desencadenado</em>: The Translation of Percy Shelley’s <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> in the Spanish-American Tradition.”
       This essay unpacks the Shelleyan inspiration and thematic echoes in a well-known classic by the Cuban novelist, Alejo Carpentier. In his reevaluation of <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, Miranda traces the Hispanophone afterlife of one of Shelley’s more difficult works. Revivified in the postmodern imagination of Carpentier, the drama of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is recast in New York City, Caracas, and the South American jungle, combining elements of mystical settings, lyric, dramatic style, and philosophic attempts at “reversing human error.” This novel, written in Venezuela in 1950 and considered a precursor to magical realism, is, Miranda argues, “perhaps one of the most earnest and profound engagements with Shelley’s text since the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth century.” This statement is supported by the relative dearth of Spanish-language receptions of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, in both Spain and Latin America, which for nearly two centuries has only seen partial translations and even fewer adaptations. Miranda contextualizes his analysis of <em>Los pasos perdidos</em> by turning to an article from 1922 in the radical Venezuelan newspaper <em>El Universal</em>, which commemorates the centenary of Shelley’s death. This column, written by Edouard Herriot, who eventually became prime minister of France, praises <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> and venerates Shelley for his “current” and “eternal” poetic ideals. Besides these two homages by Herriot and Carpentier, Latin American afterlives of this closet drama are sparse. Adding to the fact that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was not translated in full into Spanish until 1994, Miranda’s research reaffirms the surprising belatedness of the Hispanophone reception of Shelley’s text.</p><p>In the fourth essay of this volume,
        “Toward Unity: Cernuda and English Romanticism,”
       Gabriel Insausti presents a capacious study of the Spanish writer Luis Cernuda and his poetic appropriation of the English Romantic aesthetic and sensibility. A member of the Generation of '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 during the Spanish Civil War to deliver lectures at Oxford and Cambridge; he traveled to Glasgow, Cambridge, and London through 1947; and finally settled in Mexico, never to return to Spain. As an exile in Scotland and England, his writing, criticism, and translations felt the influence of Shakespeare, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Browning, and Eliot. In his essay, Insausti pinpoints a Cernudian reading of Romanticism that raises problems unique to his geographical positioning and literary historical moment: The Spanish poet encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the era, negotiating questions of poetry’s ethical value and pertinence during an era of modern warfare. Reading <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and echoing Shelley a century later, Cernuda asks, “What is a poet?” “Poetry is not only useful,” he decides, “but also has certain social effects.” A poet and translator himself, Insausti offers an encompassing view of how Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own poetics, negotiating an English tradition with a Spanish one, while balancing his Romantic interests against contemporary Modernist pressures.</p><p>Our volume ends with two contributions featuring the afterlife of John Keats in Latin America. Marco Ramírez Rojas focuses on the poet’s reception and critical influence through the eyes of Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar, two great giants of Argentine letters. In
        “Keatsians in Argentina: Borges’s Nightingale and Cortázar’s Chameleon,”
       Ramírez argues that both writers depicted and identified Keats as a misunderstood figure who needed to be rescued by their intervention. In this vein, they seek to integrate Keats as a member of their own intellectual community, regarding him “not as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” This focus on Argentina as a major site of literary transmission for Keats is historically interesting, considering the high rates of European immigration to the country in the nineteenth century and the accompanying nostalgia for British literature, encouraged by a “sort of pro-British snobbery” that pervaded Buenos Aires high society. Ramírez’s reading of Borges’s 1952 essay
        “Keats’s Nightingale”
       stages, through a philosophical defense of Keats, a petition for appropriating Keats into a Latin American space that is presented as more suitable for understanding the Romantic poet. The second half of this essay explores the lengthy creative treatise titled <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> by Cortázar, in which Ramírez theorizes the role of the biographer as a chameleon figure. Through his deep identification and sense of camaraderie with Keats, Cortázar overlaps temporalities with the poet and meets him in a shared “Latin American time” with strong political implications. Cortázar’s connection to Keats emulates the ideas of Negative Capability and the chameleon figure, mirroring a state of poetic annihilation and self-identification.</p><p>The final essay of the collection, by Olivia Loksing Moy, offers a closer look at <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>, Cortázar’s literary biography from the 1950s.
        “To Carry Keats in Your Pocket: Julio Cortázar’s Everyman Poet”
       explores the amphibious nature of a book that oscillates between a rigorous work of criticism and a playful work of fiction that defies all traditional classifications. Borrowing from Cortázar’s short fiction, Moy uses the models of playing hopscotch and blowing up photos to explain the work of a poet-critic that has been rendered inaccessible to scholarship due to two defining characteristics: its transtemporality and generic hybridity. It is her contention that the “merging of time and epochs” which brings Keats, Shelley, and Hunt together with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine intellectuals is a clever strategy, proposing a defiant sense of timeless contemporaneity. Building upon the two models of playing “hopscotch” and “blow-up,” drawn from the titles of two of Cortázar’s most acclaimed works, Moy shows how the narrative of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> skips around from year to year, while also lingering and zooming in on key moments for biographical exegesis. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for the biographer to stage a direct dialogue with Keats and to personally inhabit a Romantic universality, rendering the poet accessible to the Latin American “everyman.” Stylistically and structurally, <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> also constitutes a novelty. Its “unprecedented merging of fictional and non-fiction genres” includes the dense intertwining of poetic devices, passages of free association and automatic writing, and an overarching narrative structure. For Moy, the textual complexity of this biography reflects a generic hybridity that draws from two lines of national influence: Romantic poetry and the Latin American surrealist short story. Cortázar consciously combines these two traditions without any anxiety of influence. As he both showed and stated, Latin American literature, though arriving a bit late, could “burst onto the literary scene” and enter modernity “without all the baggage” of European literature (<em>Literature Class</em> 31). By clarifying these aspects of transtemporality and generic hybridity, Moy clears the path for further investigations of <em>Imagen</em>.

        “Latin America’s 'Chiaroscuro' Byron”
       explores the ways in which Latin America and English Romanticism clashed and overlapped during the nineteenth century in their portrayals of Lord Byron. Offering a glimpse into the fervid Byromania spreading among young intellectuals in the Southern Cone, this essay traces how Byronic figures were adopted in Spanish and Portuguese by the novelist José Mármol and by the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvarez de Azevedo. Ultimately, Byron’s image was viewed in Latin America through a diversifying chiaroscuro effect, in which Argentina’s Byron was luminous and ethereal, but Brazil’s Byron was dark and brooding. But this influence exerted by Byron was not unidirectional. The essay concludes by suggesting ways in which Simón Bólivar served as an inspiration for Lord Byron, modeling both literary freedom and political independence.</p></section></div><!--TEI body--><div class="tei_body"><section class="essay" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><header><h1><span class="head">Latin America’s “Chiaroscuro” Byron</span></h1></header><div class="byline"><span class="docAuthor">Stephen M.

This coming-together took a variety of forms: Lord Byron for example, had a profound influence on a number of nineteenth-century Latin American writers, including the Argentine novelist, José Mármol (1818–1871) who has a scene in his novel, <em>Amalia</em> (1851), based on the reading of Byron’s poems, and the Brazilian poet Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo (1831–1852) whose work exudes Byromania. But the influence was not only one way. In the concluding section of our essay, we point to how the celebrated figure of Latin America’s independence, Simón Bolívar (1783–1830), encouraged Byron in his pursuit of not only literary but also political freedom.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>It is well-known that Byron’s reputation abroad often eclipsed his stature in his homeland, where his morality was rejected by many as “questionable”—he was accused of sodomy while at school in Harrow, at university in Cambridge, and in the Mediterranean while completing his Grand Tour, and of committing incest with his half-sister, Augusta Leigh—and for this reason Dean Ireland refused to accept his body for burial in Westminster Abbey when it arrived from Greece in the spring of 1824.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">
            (1)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Byron was subsequently buried in the Church of St Mary Magdalene in Hucknall, Nottinghamshire.</span></div></div> Seen as a hero in Greece, as a result of his struggles on behalf of Greek independence in the early 1820s (Trayiannoudi), Byron was also admired as the principal figure of Romanticism in a number of European countries, including France (Wilkes and Cochran), Switzerland (Giddey), Italy (Zuccato and Iamartino), Spain (Flitter and Cardwell), Portugal (Machado de Souza), Romania (Anghelescu), Germany (Pointner &amp; Geisenhanslüke), Holland (D’haen), the Czech Republic (Procházka), Poland (Modrzewska), Hungary (Rákai), Russia (Diakonova &amp; Vatsuro), Bulgaria (Kostadinova), Denmark (Nielsen), Norway (Tysdahl), Sweden (Elam), Armenia (Bekaryan), Georgia (Merabishvili) and Turkey (Demata). One of the aims of this essay is to provide some sense of the influence created in Latin America by Byron to complement Richard’s Cardwell two-volume study of <em>The Reception of Byron in Europe</em> (2004). In Europe, as Cardwell suggests, Byron represented a “counterweight to the political aims of Europe’s rulers in the aftermath of the Napoleonic era” (
        “Introduction”
       1); he stood for “the struggle for the liberty of oppressed peoples and the struggle to define a new artistic language for the expression of that desire for freedom, social and individual” (
        “Introduction”
       1–2). To quote Cardwell once more, each recipient of Byron “adopted and adapted Byron to their needs; each individual writer employed Byron as a mirror to his own personal obsessions. Each nation used him to create their own literary history” (
        “Introduction”
       4). While no country in Latin America experienced Byromania as intensely as Spain did through the person of José de Espronceda (Churchman; Pujals; Flitter 138–41), Byron’s ideas, particularly his “revolt against Christian and rationalist belief” (Cardwell,
        “Introduction”
       2), had a definitive impact on various Latin American countries, and he became an icon standing for political as well as artistic freedom. That impact was not experienced, though, in a uniform way across Latin America; while Argentina’s Byron was luminous and ethereal, Brazil’s was dark and brooding. This was part and parcel, as we shall see, of Byron’s “chiaroscuro” effect in Latin America.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Indeed, on one specific count, Latin America’s Byron was sharply distinct from the European prototype. As we explore in the third section of this essay, Byron not only produced a concrete impact on writers across Latin America, he was also himself influenced in a number of crucial ways by one of Latin America’s most iconic figures, Simón Bolívar. This fact allows us to argue, as far as one of the iconic figures of English Romanticism is concerned, that Latin America was not simply a receptor of the “obliterating glare of Byronic light” (Barton 291),<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

The pendulum swinging between English Romanticism (as typified by Byron) and Latin America led to a chiaroscuro effect in which Latin America reflected back as much as it soaked up the “brilliance” and “light” emanating from England’s Romanticism.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

Carilla provides us with a list of the European writers who had the greatest impact in Spanish America in the Romantic period, and Byron—along with Walter Scott—is on that list.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

        “Preámbulo de un drama.”
       The main drama portrayed in Mármol’s novel is the struggle between the “Unitarios” and the “Federales” which tore Argentina apart in the years immediately following Argentina’s independence. The “Federales” were backed by the dictator José Manuel Rosas, and the Unitarian faction favored establishing and enhancing links with Europe in commercial as well as cultural terms, and <em>Amalia</em> was a book that fiercely defended the position of the Unitarian camp. Little surprise, therefore, that at one juncture in the novel, the
        “Preamble of a Drama,”
       we see the two main Unitarian protagonists, Amalia and Eduardo, who are Romantic lovers, enraptured in their reading and translation of Byron’s poetry: <span class="quote">‘Eran las cinco de una tarde fría y nebulosa, y al lado de la chimenea, sentado en un pequeño taburete a los pies de Amalia, Eduardo le traducía uno de los más bellos pasajes del <em>Manfredo</em>, de Byron; y Amalia, reclinado su brazo sobre el hombre de Eduardo y rozando con sus rizos de seda su alta y pálida frente, lo oía, enajenada, más por la que llegaba hasta su corazón, que por los bellos raptos de la imaginación del poeta; y de cuando en cuando Eduardo levantaba su cabeza para buscar en los ojos de su Amalia un raudal mayor de poesía que el que brotaban los pensamientos del águila de los poetas del siglo XIX. (Mármol 199)’</span> A number of points deserve mentioning about this scene. The excerpt suggests that the musings of Byron’s imagination had transfused Latin America’s Romantic imagination, normalizing the integration of his <em>Manfred</em> in an Argentine setting. Eduardo is depicted as translating <em>Manfred</em> for Amalia, and Amalia is “enajenada” (“deranged,” lit. “out of herself”) as a result of listening to the “raptures” of the poet’s imagination. Byron is here seen as an icon offering access to authentic Romantic love, since Eduardo uses his recitation of Byron’s poetry as a pathway to finding a source of poetry that is even deeper than Byron’s poetry—within Amalia’s eyes. The esteem in which Byron was held in Argentina is suggested by the fact that he is described in this passage as “the eagle of nineteenth-century poets.” Byron’s work could be co-opted into a political project. For, while Amalia and Eduardo love poetry, their main aim is to destroy Rosas and, as the novel demonstrates, it is a political struggle in which they will one day lose their lives.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Further indication of the importance of Byron’s work in the Unitarian literary circles of Buenos Aires is the following scene in which their accomplice, Daniel, arrives and asks Amalia and Eduardo what they are reading.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

The interest in Byron was clearly not restricted to a few party-pieces.</span></div></div> They ask him to guess, and they tease him when he gets it wrong—first Daniel says it is Voltaire, then Rousseau, Napoleon, and finally Don Pedro de Angelis,<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

Eso no tomaba café, por la razón de que era la bebida favorita de Napoleón; porque has de saber, mi Amalia, que Byron no aborrecía a Napoleón, pero tenía celos de su gloria, por cuanto sabía el taimado inglés que con él y con Napoleón debían morir las dos grandes glorias de su siglo, y con toda su alma hubiese querido que no muriese más gloria que la suya.” (Mármol 199)</p></blockquote> That Napoleon and Byron are portrayed as tripping simultaneously off Daniel’s tongue as—between them—the “two great glories of their century” points once more to the lofty esteem that Byron’s work enjoyed in Argentina’s literary circles throughout the nineteenth century. As we see, Byron’s impact in Latin America elicited political as well as literary structures of feeling.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4"><h2><span class="head">Byron and Álvares de Azevedo</span></h2><div class="wrapper"><p>The literary coteries of Brazil in the early to mid-nineteenth century were, according to a number of accounts, packed to the rafters with poets who suffered from acute Byromania. As the Brazilian novelist José de Alencar recalls, when he was a student in the Law Faculty of the University of São Paolo, everyone wanted to be like Byron: <span class="quote">‘Em 1845 voltou-me o prurido de escritor: mas êsse ano foi consagrado à mania que então grassava de byronizar. Todo estudante de alguma imaginação queria ser um Byron, e tinha por destino inexorável copiar ou traduzir o bardo inglês. . . .

Que satisfação não íntima não tive eu, quando um estudante . . . releu com entusiasmo uma dessas poesias, seduzido sem dúvida pelo nome do pseudo-autor. (Qtd. in Magalhães Júnior 39) ’</span> The members, for example, of the Epicurus Society had a penchant for Byron-inspired and alcohol-fuelled sessions involving desecration in graveyards, black magic, Satanism, and orgies lasting a fortnight (Freire 26–50; Magalhães Júnior 45–54), and the most prominent Byromaniac of all was Manuel Antônio Álvares de Azevedo. The critic Ronald de Carvalho once called Álvares de Azevedo’s poetry “Byronesque” (“byroniana”; Pacheco Jordão 3) and the name stuck. While studying at the Colégio Pedro II, Álvares de Azevedo read the great names of the European Romantic movement—the likes of <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois-Ren%C3%A9_de_Chateaubriand">François-René de Chateaubriand</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_de_Musset">Alfred de Musset</a>, <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, and <a class="link_ref" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphonse_de_Lamartine">Alphonse de Lamartine</a>—but Byron was his idol.

This type of bracketing of his experience within, as it were, Byron’s algorithm is also evident in Álvares de Azevedo’s frequent use of quotations drawn from Byron’s work as epigraphs for his poems (see Álvares de Azevedo 171, 233, 279, 319, 328, 390, 396, 412, 419, 450). He was clearly obsessed with Byron, referring to him on numerous occasions in his Speech of Acceptance into Brazil’s Academic Society given on 9 May 1850 (Álvares de Azevedo 760–66), and he even at one stage began writing letters in English to his Portuguese-speaking mother (Álvares de Azevedo 775–76;
        “My Cousin Inácio has been very bad with a gathering in his ear and has had leeches applied”
       776). For Álvares de Azevedo, “Byron, sob seu manto negro de Don Juan, guardava no peito uma chaga dorida e funda” (Álvares de Azevedo 700). In his citation, bracketing and re-working of Byron’s work, Álvares de Azevedo focused on the gloomy, gothic and satanic side of the great English Romantic at the expense of that lighter side which had attracted Argentine readers.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5"><h2><span class="head">Bolívar and Byron</span></h2><p>Simón Bolívar never met Lord Byron but there were enough similarities in their lives to justify comparison. Their dates almost overlap—their respective birth-dates differing by five years (Bolívar was the older) and their deaths by just six years (Byron died in 1824, Bolívar in 1830)—and both were seen by their contemporaries as great men of their time. Unlike Byron, who gained his fame as one of the leading lights of English Romanticism, Bolívar forged his career as a soldier and a politician, and he single-handedly liberated half of the Sub-Continent of South America. In 1815, he published <em>La carta de Jamaica</em> (<em>The Jamaican Letter</em>) which eloquently made the case for Spanish America’s Independence from Spain. In the summer of 1816, Bolívar declared the freedom of slaves in the Americas (Lynch 109). The Congress of Angostura held in February 1819 solidified Bolívar’s place as supreme leader of the new Republic of Venezuela (Bushnell, <em>Simón Bolívar</em> 96), while his decisive victory against Spain’s royalist troops at Boyacá in August 1819 led to the Independence of New Granada and the creation of Colombia (Bushnell, <em>Simón Bolívar</em> 108–11). Bolívar was committed to the independence as well as union of the newly-formed states of Spanish America, and—while it was still unpopular to do so in many parts of the Sub-Continent—he was unconditionally opposed to the existence of slavery and racism in the New World. He explicitly rejected the use of race as a divide among the different populations from which he sought to forge one unified nation (see Aguilar Rivera). But for all his idealism, Bolívar was a pragmatist, and he knew his dreams would be hard to achieve. As he pointed out in <em>La carta de Jamaica</em>: <span class="quote">‘No somos indios ni europeos, sino una especie media entre los legítimos propietarios del país y los usrpadores españoles; en suma, siendo nosotros amerianos por nacimiento y nuestros derechos los de Europa, tenemos que disputar éstos a los del país y que mantenernos en él contra la invasión de los invasores; así nos hallamos en el caso más extroardinario y complicado. (Bolívar 46) ’</span> Self-determination and a mixed population went hand in glove in Bolívar’s proposed blueprint for an independent and free nation. The great Venezuelan leader “proposed a unitary state, with a life-president and a system of indirect election of some officials,” characterized by a “moral power” which would be exercised by censors who would “oversee the operation of the school system, the behavior of individuals, the protection of the constitution, and the rights of the people” (Fitzgerald 8). One striking feature of Bolívar’s proposed system was that he “felt that England should ally itself with the Spanish-American countries” (Fitzgerald 8). Indeed, it was no secret that Bolívar admired British parliamentarianism (Bushnell,
        “Introduction”
       xlii), and this would have caught the eye of a Member of the House of Lords, as Byron was at this time. Indeed, from a young age, Byron had been intent on a career in politics with poetry initially being only a secondary interest. In the first speech he gave to the House of Lords, in 1812, he expressed his opposition to the heavy hand of social control by arguing against the bill calling for the punishment by death of “Luddites” who were destroying industrial machinery; his belief in freedom even at the expense of the authority of the State and the Church was unusual for the time.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Perhaps even more significant, Bolívar and Byron could both trace back their political awakening to an admiration of Napoleon Bonaparte. It was during the period 1804–1806 that Bolívar, living in Europe at the time, experienced a political awakening that was caused by Napoleon’s ascension to power (Lynch 24–25; 44–45).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Bushnell notes that Bolívar was “captivated by, and frankly admired, the cult of glory that was so important a trait of the French leader and that Bolívar would not hesitate to imitate in due course” (Bushnell, Simón Bolívar 11).</span></div></div> Byron, for his part, had depicted Napoleon as an iconic figure in <em>Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage:</em> <blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">There is a very life in our despair,</div><div class="l">Vitality of poison – a quick root</div><div class="l">Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were</div><div class="l">As nothing did we die; but Life will suit</div><div class="l">Itself to Sorrow’s most detested fruit,</div><div class="l">Like to the apples on the Dead Sea’s shore,</div><div class="l">All ashes to the taste.</div><div class="indent2">(Canto III, Stanza XXXIV, lines 1–7; Hartley Coleridge 190)</div></div></blockquote> The figure of Napoleon here—as one critic has noted, “extreme in both grandeur and misery” (Blackstone 187)—is fused with the poem’s narrator, for the despair oozing from his is “our” despair. Byron sympathized with Napoleon as the tragic hero and saw in him a version of the complicated syntax of his own life.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>As his biographer Bernard Blackstone points outs, Byron, by the end of 1819—that is, precisely when Bolívar’s star was rising in the New World—was growing tired of his life in Europe (“an outworn portion of the globe,” as he called it), and, by October 1819, he was actively making plans to emigrate to Venezuela (Blackstone 308). As Byron wrote in a letter to John Cam Hobhouse from Venice, dated October 3, 1819: <span class="quote">‘My South American project, of which I believe I spoke to you (as you mention it)—was this. I perceived by the enclosed paragraphs [newspaper cuttings] that advantageous offers were—or are to be held out to settlers in the Venezuela territory. My affairs in England are nearly settled or in prospect of settlement; in Italy I have no debts, and I could leave it when I choose. The Anglo-Americans are a little too coarse for me, and their climate too cold, and I should prefer the others. I could soon grapple with the Spanish language. Ellice or others would get me letters to Bolivar and his government, and if men of little, or no property are encouraged there, surely with present income, and—if I could sell Rochdale—with some capital, I might be suffered as a landholder there, or at least a tenant, and if possible, and legal—a Citizen. I wish you would speak to <em>Perry of the M[orning] C[hronicle]</em>—who is their Gazetteer—about this, and ask like Jeremy Diddler—not for eighteen pence—but information on the subject. I assure you that I am very <em>serious</em> in the idea, and that the notion has been about me for a long time, as you will see by the worn state of the advertisement. I should go there with my natural daughter, Allegra—now nearly three years old, and with me here,—and pitch my tent for good and all. (Howarth 275–76)’</span> Byron was clearly excited by the news arriving from the New World about Bolívar’s adventures, and it is fitting, therefore, that he should have named an instrument of his own adventures after the great Venezuelan. In January 1822, Byron found himself in northern Italy with a fellow Englishman, Shelley, and they decided that they would each buy a boat to entertain themselves in between writing their poetic works.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Byron was working on Don Juan at this time.</span></div></div> Ernest Hartley Coleridge takes up the story for us: <span class="quote">‘At the beginning of the New Year, Byron and Shelley turned their thoughts to the sea. Two of the Pisa friends, Trelawny and Williams, were accomplished seamen, and, acting on their advice and recommendation, Byron commissioned a certain Captain Roberts, who was an authority on boat-building, to build an open boat for Shelley, and large decked one for his own use. In due course, a schooner, the <em>Bolivar</em>, was built for Byron, and Shelley was provided with a boat thirty feet long, which Trelawny christened <em>Don Juan</em>, but the owner insisted on re-naming the <em>Ariel</em>. To be near, Shelley had taken a villa on the Gulf of Spezia. (Hartley Coleridge xlvi)’</span> In January 1822—when Byron named his boat after Bolívar—the Venezuelan was already planning his next decisive attack on Quito (Bushnell, <em>Simón Bolívar</em> 124–26), from where, once consolidated, he would then strike at the heart of Spain’s control-post in Latin America, Lima.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note10" id="Note10_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In July 1822 Bolívar had met with the other great Liberator of Spanish America, José de San Martín, and had in effect banished him from future influence in the liberation of Spanish America (Lynch 172–75). And, then, on December 1824 Bolívar’s troops, at the Battle of Ayacucho, in Peru’s principal Andean city, had defeated Spain’s royalist army, leading to the unconditional surrender of all of Spain’s forces in Peru and Upper Peru, and thereby made Spanish America free from Spain’s control (Lynch 193–95). In August 1825 a new country was created, and named after Bolívar, Bolivia (Lynch 198–200…</span></div></div> Byron had expressed admiration for other freedom causes in the past—he once sympathized with France’s cause, as expressed in Napoleon Bonaparte’s ambitions, as mentioned above, and he had expressed support for Italian freedom by supporting the Carbonari (Blackstone 309)—but it was Bolívar’s fight for independence, its temerity and the seeming hopelessness of the quest, that struck a chord in Byron’s soul.</p></div><p>Byron’s decision to buy a boat along with Shelley was, as it turned out, an ill-fated event—on July 7, 1822 Shelley drowned in a tragic accident while sailing in the <em>Ariel</em> with Williams in the Gulf of Spezia. The bodies of Shelley and Williams were discovered not far from the beach at Viareggio, and Byron and his companion, Leigh Hunt, decided to conduct a proper funeral for them on the lake-shore (Hartley Coleridge xlvi–xlvii). As Byron wrote in a letter to Moore dated August 27, 1822: <span class="quote">‘We have been burning the bodies of Shelley and Williams on the sea-shore, to render them fit for removal and regular interment. You can have no idea what an extraordinary effect such a funeral pile has on a desolate shore, with mountains in the back-ground and the sea before, and the singular appearance the salt and frankincense gave to the flame. All of Shelley was consumed except his <em>heart</em>, which would not take the flame, and is now preserved in spirits of wine. (Barzun 235)’</span> Byron even swam out to see his own boat, the <em>Bolivar</em>, which was moored nearby to the beach while Shelley’s body was being consumed by the flames: “The other day at Viareggio, I thought proper to swim off to my schooner (the Bolivar) in the offing, and thence to shore again—about three miles, or better, in all” (Barzun 234). Byron appears to have experienced extreme and contradictory emotions as a result of Shelley’s untimely death, and, perhaps understandably, Shelley became something of a “troubling presence” in the collection of poems Byron was composing at that time, <em>Don Juan</em> (Bloom 24).</p><div class="wrapper"><p>It is surely no coincidence that Byron decided—just fourteen months after naming his boat the <em>Bolivar</em>—to embrace the cause of Greek Independence and journey to Greece in order to save it from tyranny. Byron had been contacted by the “Greek Committee,” based in London and consisting of Jeremy Bentham, Lord Erskine, Sir James Mackintosh, and J.C. Hobhouse, and unanimously made a member of that committee which was fighting on behalf of Greece’s Independence.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note11" id="Note11_return"><sup class="super">
            (11)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For a discussion of the connections between Bentham and Bolívar, see Hart 336.</span></div></div> The vote occurred on March 14, 1822, and, as Byron suggested to Thomas Moore in a letter dated August 27, 1822: “I had, and still have, thoughts of South America, but am fluctuating between it and Greece. I should have gone, long ago, to one of them, but for my liaison with the Countess G.; for love, in these days, is little compatible with glory” (Barzun). The important point to be drawn from this extract is that Byron saw South America and Greece, in the summer of 1822, as offering alternative routes to a similar end.</p></div><p>By the end of the summer, as he told Trelawny, Byron was “at last determined to go to Greece” (Hartley Coleridge li). He subsequently sold the <em>Bolivar</em> and he bought a bigger ship, the <em>Hercules</em>. He then sailed to the west coast of Cephalonia, recruited a small army, and initiated high-level diplomatic negotiations in preparation for an attack on the mainland. As Byron informed J.C. Hobhouse, in a letter dated April 7, 1823, he had “even offered to go up to the Levant in July, if the Greek provisional government think that I could be of any use” (Barzun 240). As he wrote to Augusta Leigh on October 12, 1823: <span class="quote">‘You ask me why I came up amongst the Greeks? It was stated to me that my so doing might tend to their advantage in some measure in their present struggle for independence, both as an individual and as a member for the Committee now in England. How far this may be realized I cannot pretend to anticipate, but I am willing to do what I can. (Barzun 250) ’</span> It was while Byron was getting ready for the attack that, as so often in his life, he turned to his poetry as an outlet for mulling over his actions. And thus we find that, even while he was bent on liberating Greece, Bolívar was still in his thoughts. Byron began <em>The Age of Bronze</em> in December 1822 and he finished it on January 10, 1823, and in this collection of poems the Liberator is portrayed as a modern-day titan, part of the political thunder and lightning that created freedom in the New World, emerging first in the Northern hemisphere and then spreading to the Sub-Continent: </p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">While Franklin’s quiet memory climbs to Heaven,</div><div class="l">Calming the lightning which he hence have riven,</div><div class="l">Or drawing from the no less kindled earth</div><div class="l">Freedom and peace to that which boasts his birth;</div><div class="l">While Washington’s a watchword, such as ne’er</div><div class="l">Shall sink while there’s an echo left to air:</div><div class="l">While even the Spaniard’s thirst of gold and war</div><div class="l">Forgets Pizarro to shout Bolivar!</div><div class="indent2">(<em>The Age of Bronze</em>, Canto V, lines 116–23; Hartley Coleridge 749)</div></div></blockquote><p> It was this spark of the “good old days,” as Byron goes on to suggest, that was behind the breath of fresh air ushering in freedom in the Atlantic nations: </p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">But ‘twill not be – the spark’s awakened – lo!</div><div class="l">The swarthy Spaniard feels his former glow;</div><div class="l">The same high spirit which beat back the Moor</div><div class="l">Though eight long ages of alternate gore</div><div class="l">Revives – and where?

A Congress! What! That hallowed name</div><div class="l">Which freed the Atlantic! May we hope the same</div><div class="l">For outworn Europe? With the sound arise</div><div class="l">Like Samuel’s shade to Saul’s monarchic eyes,</div><div class="l">The prophets of young Freedom, summoned far</div><div class="l">From climes of Washington and Bolivar.</div><div class="indent2">(<em>The Age of Bronze</em>, Canto VIII, lines 1–6; Hartley Coleridge 751)</div></div></blockquote><p> Clearly the example of the liberation of the New World was inspirational for Byron in those crucial years from 1819 onwards when he was contemplating how to implement greater freedom in the world. Though Bolívar was not a major figure in Byron’s <em>Don Juan</em>, nevertheless the political rebellion of Peru is recalled: Cadiz is described as the “mart of the colonial trade (…) before Peru learned to rebel” (<em>Don Juan</em>, Canto II, Chapter V; Hartley Coleridge 805).</p><p>With the benefit of hindsight we can see Byron’s mission to liberate Greece as doomed from the start, for Byron was attempting to re-create Bolívar’s “criollo”-backed independence movement in a diametrically opposed political environment. Byron’s journey to Greece in 1823 is redolent in a sense of Che Guevara’s ill-fated mission to Bolivia in 1967, which sought to make the Revolution happen in a place it couldn’t happen. As the letters penned during this period demonstrate, Byron was having all sorts of problems in Messalonghi, including dealing with internal dissension among the Greek factions, bouts of illness (apoplexy or epilepsy), enormous debts, earthquakes, and narrow escapes from the Turks (Howarth 456–61). Before he had even mustered sufficient forces to launch an attack on the mainland, Byron was struck down by fever, and he died off the shores of Greece on April 19, 1824. As Hartley Coleridge notes: “The Greeks were heartbroken at the death of their hero” (Hartley Coleridge lv). To this day, Greeks see Byron’s death as a personal tragedy for the Greek nation (Trayiannoudi).</p><p>Byron’s relationship with the world outside the British Isles, as portrayed in the excellent two-volume book on <em>The Reception of Byron in Europe</em> (ed. Richard Cardwell), demonstrates how Byronism took on “local colors” in different parts of the world. Our own study of Latin America’s Byron has investigated a similar range of receptivities to Byromania in different countries—ranging from the brooding and dark Byron in Brazil to the ethereal and uplifting one in Argentina—but it has also uncovered something unique about the relationship between Byron and Latin America, namely, that his “light” travelled not, as elsewhere, as if obeying a one-way system but that it produced a “chiaroscuro” effect when it arrived in Latin America. The Latin American prism was suddenly transformed into a mirror capable of bouncing Byron’s light back to its source. Bolívar’s military as well as political successes, as noted above, clearly had an impact on Byron between 1819 and his premature death in 1824; these events persuaded the great English poet to grasp the nettle of the independence movement in Greece, lay down his pen, and take up his sword. It was not all in vain, though, for those “whom the Gods love die young” (<em>Don Juan</em>, Canto IV, Chapter IV; Hartley Coleridge 844).</p></div><div class="citation" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.6"><h2><span class="head">Works Cited</span></h2><div class="biblfree">Aguilera Rivera, José Antonio.

The twentieth century saw the consecration of vampire literature in Latin America. However, this acclimatization could not have been possible without the role carried out by translators during the nineteenth century. “Translation” in the context of this discussion recovers its etymological meaning, since it not only conveys the transference between languages, but also of spatial dissemination, as an import “transferred” or “carried out” from one place to another, from Europe to the Americas. <div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

Considering the central role of Byron in the vampiric craze during the Romantic era, stemming both from the association of his public persona to this mythical monster and the long-lasting misattribution of John Polidori’s canonical tale, a proper study of translations of Byron seems necessary to articulate a more comprehensive and accurate historicization of early stages of this subgenre in Latin America.

Subsequently, I will analyze the most significant features and stylistic choices of the translator’s rendition. Finally, I will argue why Zapata’s contribution can be interpreted as a counter-discourse to Domingo Faustino Sarmiento’s formulation of
        “Civilization and Barbarism.”
       As important as his role as a translator was, no less fascinating is Zapata’s implicit position in narratives of progress and modernity that characterized the political arena of nineteenth-century Argentina. As James Cisneros hints in passing, Byron’s worldview contrasted greatly with the most dogmatic formulations of
        “Civilization and Barbarism”
       (251), which presented a black-and-white agenda for progress in Argentina. By bringing to the fore a text that strayed beyond socially-prescribed boundaries concerning morals and modernity, Zapata forced his readers to question the simple binaries so fervently sustained at the time.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2"><h2><span class="head">I. <em>The Giaour</em> by Byron: A Challenging Visitor to the Americas</span></h2><div class="wrapper"><p>Before delving into the historical coordinates that informed Byron translations prior to Zapata’s rendition, it is worth reviewing the plot and main features of <em>The Giaour</em>. T.S. Eliot provides an insightful summary of the poem: <span class="quote">‘A Christian, presumably a Greek, has managed, by some means of which we are not told, to scrape acquaintance with a young woman who belonged to the harem, or was perhaps the favorite wife of a Moslem named Hassan. In the endeavor to escape with her Christian lover, Leila is recaptured and killed; in due course the Christian with some of his friends ambushes and kills Hassan. We subsequently discover that the story of this vendetta—or part of it—is being told by the Giaour himself to an elderly priest, by way of making his confession. (227–28) ’</span> Eliot efficiently outlines the story here; however, in what would become a classic move in frequent receptions of the text in the Hispanic world, he significantly skips any mention of the vampire subplot.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>This move could be attributed to a wide range of reasons, including the relatively independent character of the supernatural episode within the rest of the poem.</span></div></div> As the Christian protagonist kills Hassan, the latter invokes a curse upon him that prophesies the ultimate transformation of the protagonist into a vampire. This episode is limited to thirty lines, and runs, depending on the edition, from approximately line 755 to line 786.

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>As Derek Flitter points out, the Romantic fervor about Byron’s works was initially linked to his image as a leading cultivator of the sublime (135). Interestingly, the association between the English lord and vampire literature takes root very quickly in the Spanish language and constitutes a crucial factor of this early reception of Byron in the Hispanic world. In 1824, an editorial from Barcelona attributes the first Peninsular translation of Polidori’s The Vampire to Lord Byron. Within the Parisian editorial house of Librería Americana, this misattribution reoccurs in 1829, consolidating th…</span></div></div> From that celebrated encounter at Villa Diodati where John Polidori, Mary Shelley, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Clair Clairmont gathered in Geneva during the Year Without Summer of 1816, only one text by Byron has survived—
        “The Fragment of a Novel,”
       later included in the publication of <em>Mazeppa</em> in 1819 (Aquilina, 27–30; Glantz 5). Yet, considering the inchoate and truncated nature of this narrative, it would be arguable to consider it within the canon of vampire literature at all. Furthermore, Byron would later (in most likelihood embittered by the attribution of Polidori’s tale) forcibly remove himself from any association with those iconic bloodsucking monsters: “I have . . . a personal dislike to ‘Vampires,’ and the little acquaintance I have with them would by no means induce me to divulge their secrets” (
        “Letter of Lord Byron”
       151). In brief, despite the strong association between Byron and the vampiric theme, the aforementioned passage in <em>The Giaour</em> remains his sole explicit contribution to this lineage.</p></div><p>Among the varied facets deserving attention in this narrative poem, I would like to briefly highlight some key aspects of the original that are useful in measuring the worth of Martín Zapata’s translation. To begin, <em>The Giaour</em> offers an intriguing complication of the orientalist paradigm, as it casts the Christian lover through Eastern eyes. By framing the main character as a representation of the West, as a <em>Gavur</em> or “infidel,” the poem takes the perspective of the traditional Other. The protagonist is framed by the gaze of the East. As the text shifts the focus from comfortable exoticization of the oriental subject to a matter of perspective, it could be argued that Byron problematizes, to some extent, the “geographical binaries” that legitimized European colonialism (Rangarajan 55). In <em>The Giaour</em>, it is precisely the representation of the West that is continuously subjected to scrutiny and suspicion. Certainly, as postcolonial critic Padma Rangarajan has pointed out, this inversion of perspectives is limited to “an audacious moment of colonial ventriloquism,” characteristic of some forward-thinking romantics (55). Yet this textual stance must have been deemed necessarily problematic by some audiences, especially in emergent Latin American republics such as Argentina, where models of modernity led to the excision of any non-Western elements as signs of presumed backwardness. In choosing <em>The Giaour</em>, Martín Zapata was implicitly placing himself in a singular position among his intellectual peers.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Adding to the complication of the orientalist paradigm, we must add the uncharacteristic portrayal of the doomed-to-be vampire protagonist. As a quintessential Byronic hero, <em>The Giaour</em> is a somewhat sympathetic Gothic villain doomed by fate to carry out death and destruction upon his loved ones against his will (Thorslev 150–151). Departing from the otherness inherently attached to some of the most recognizable vampires in literary tradition (such as Sheridan Le Fanu’s <em>Carmilla</em> or Bram Stoker’s <em>Dracula</em>), Byron’s cursed Giaour evinces a complex character, neither entirely innocent nor completely guilty. Therefore, the text elicits the monster within us all, the vampire we might become when touched by ill fate and the unbridled thirst of vengeance.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
            (6)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It must be noted that The Giaour’s vampiric transformation is merely shown though a prophecy and not in action. Its vagueness forces the audience to determine, by the end of the story, whether Hassan’s curse is or is not to blame for the unnamed sins admitted in confession later on by the protagonist.</span></div></div> Again, as we will see, the moral ambiguity of Byron’s original could hardly fit well within the clear-cut distinctions aimed by progressive intellectuals such as Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (1811–1874), the future president of Argentina.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Hispanic resistance towards Gothic horror and fantastic supernaturalism adds an additional key to appreciating Zapata’s initiative as a translator. According to José María Martínez, the institutional demands of the emergent Latin American republics enforced a social-political inflection to Romantic ideals that, along with the reawakening of the enlightened instrumentalization of imagination, led most writers to postpone the use of fantastic aesthetics (55–56). Until the end of the 1850s, and especially after 1860 (with the later impact of Edgar Allan Poe), is it difficult to trace a quantitative and qualitatively stronger corpus of supernatural tales in Latin America.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

Through brief and scattered political notes of the period, it is possible to place Zapata among the liberal intellectuals who opposed José Manuel de Rosas, the dictator who ruled Argentina between 1835 and 1852.

Despite its short run, with only four issues in 1841, <em>Crónica</em> played a significant role in providing cohesion to a liberal unitarian party in risk of disbandment. Later political differences seem to have broken the friendship between Sarmiento and Zapata soon after. Nevertheless, by 1849, their relation must have remained strong.

Leaving aside the fragmentary renditions by Spanish-speaking intellectuals who lived in England during their time in exile (such as José María Heredia or Andrés Bello), early translations of Byron were made accessible through second-hand French versions, where taking extreme poetic license was a common practice. It is worth noting that <em>The Giaour</em> appears during this timeframe among Byron texts that traveled through Spain to some territories in Latin America. However, interest in this narrative poem would decline during the nineteenth century, as is demonstrated by the delay with which a second translation of the work would be undertaken by Zapata. Twenty years separated the first Spanish edition of <em>The Giaour</em> in Paris (1828) and the first Latin American one in Chile (1849).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note12" id="Note12_return"><sup class="super">

Not by chance, Spanish translations of the period are commonly labeled as “novelas” (“novels”) or even “cuentos poéticos” (“poetic tales”). As a result, this practice of prosification significantly altered the horizon of expectations of the initial Spanish-speaking readership (Montesinos 64; Pegenaute
        “La época romántica”
       337, 343; Medina Calzada 148). Lord Byron’s works were mostly associated in these early stages with the productions of a novel writer or even those of a playwright.

The translator seems aware of the sacrifices that result from his decision, and compensates for the loss of rhyme and meter through a wise implementation of rhythm, which approximates his rendition to the formal experiments of prose poetry as practiced in France.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note15" id="Note15_return"><sup class="super">

Instead of reproducing the mosaic of mingling and interrupted perspectives of the original, he made use of an explicit external structure. It is reasonable to suppose that the same aspects that would attract the attention of modernist poets such as T.S. Eliot in the twentieth century (fragmentation, elusiveness, disarticulation) must have been perceived as a source of disorientation by audiences of the time. A similar scenario must have occurred within the Spanish-speaking readership. Zapata likely feared the risk of confusing his audience with the meandering structure of the original. To guide his readership, he devoted individual chapters to specific parts of the narrative poem. The addition of subtitles is another of the strategies used by the Argentine to further his clarification of the plot. In Zapata’s rendition, the story is divided into twelve chapters.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Particularly relevant to our study of the vampire theme is Chapter IX,
        “The Curse”
       (20–21). There, Zapata compresses the supernatural transformation of the protagonist. This chapter could be considered in itself one of the first explorations of vampire literature in a Hispanic context. The famous passage of vampirism by Byron quoted above reads this way in Zapata’s translation: <span class="quote">‘Tu cuerpo arrancado de su tumba i convertido en vampiro, habitará cual espectro en tu tierra nativa i beberá la sangre de toda tu propia raza: allí, en la oscuridad de la medianoche, arrancarás a tu hija, a tu esposa i a tu hermana la corriente de la vida; i aunque te horrorice tu asquerosa bebida has de alimentar con ella tu lívido cadáver. - Tus víctimas, antes de espirar, reconocerán al demonio por su deudo: i maldiciéndote i maldecidos por ti, perecerán en la flor de su edad esos seres que te son tan queridos. Pero una de ellas, la más joven, la más querida de todos, te llamará con el nombre <em>padre</em>, i esta palabra sagrada te destrozará el corazón…I tus crujientes dientes y cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos, i volviéndote a tu oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios infernales huirán de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos . . . !!!!…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>With the exception of accentuation, I keep the original orthography.</span></div></div>’</span> This excerpt exemplifies Zapata’s approach as a translator. Unable to produce the rhythmic cadence of Byron’s pentameter and the alliteration of English nasal and occlusive consonants (/p/, /t/, /k/), he opts for a different palette of sounds, but with the same effect in mind: horror. For this purpose, Zapata makes a forceful, combined use of the alveolar trill /r/ and nasal consonants (/m/, /n/) throughout the passage. These are some of the clearest examples of alliteration: <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">arrancado, convertido, raza, arrancarás, corriente, horrorice, alimentar, cadáver, espirar, reconocerán, flor, cárdenos, rabiarás, porque, infernales, horrorizados</span>. These abundant examples illustrate the intentionality of the author. The taps and trills, so characteristic of the Spanish /r/, help provide this scene with a sense of urgency and aggression, while the nasal sounds provide a background tension that suitably convenes the tremendous curse invoked upon the protagonist.</p></div><p>Since Zapata does not count with the power of meter that emphasizes the fateful metric <em>ostinato</em> of the original, he has to supply other means to this end. The use of polysyndeton in relatively long sentences contribute to exacerbate the tension until its climatic resolution, with the curse of the protagonist: “<em>I</em> tus crujientes dientes <em>y</em> cárdenos labios destilarán la sangre de tus inocentes hijos, <em>i</em> volviéndote a tu oscuro sepulcro, rabiarás desesperado, porque hasta los mismos genios infernales huirán de ti horrorizados de un espectro más maldito que ellos” (21; emphases added). As if these formal means of expression were not sufficient, Zapata resorts to a hyperbolic use of punctuation. The translator not only multiplies the exclamation marks of the original, but also inserts two complete lines of periods or suspension points. Whether these signs are a representation of an unutterable horror or a sudden break of the narrative is open to interpretation. What remains clear is Zapata’s effective intention of producing an intense shock in his audience. Despite its brevity and translative character, this chapter of <em>El Giaur</em> represents one of the wildest and more explicit expressions of Gothic sensibility in nineteenth-century Latin American literature.</p><p>In the context of Argentine political discussions, the timing of Zapata’s translation makes his production particularly intriguing. By the 1830s, Byron was certainly deemed by the Argentine intellectual establishment (Esteban Echeverría, José Mármol, and Juan Bautista Alberdi) a cornerstone of the Romantic pantheon of foreign authors. However, by the 1840s, these sentiments were starting to recede, and discussions about the pertinence of Romanticism would be abundant. It is therefore surprising to note how Zapata’s publication straddles the fence of the first two extremely influential editions of Sarmiento’s <em>Facundo: Civilization y Barbarie</em> (1845, 1851).</p><div class="wrapper"><p>In its most basic tenets, <em>Facundo</em> aims at fostering a model of Western progress though critical representations of backwardness, embodied in the portrayal of gaucho leader Juan Facundo Quiroga. Along the way, Sarmiento delineates a clear-cut opposition between two antithetical cultural realities: the presumed signifiers of barbarism (indigenous peoples, <em>gauchos</em> or mixed-race cowboys, and Spaniards); and those of Western Modernity (associated with the US, UK and France). Furthermore, he does not hesitate to equate the <em>gauchos</em>’ uncivilized character with nomadic subjects of the Middle East. His “otherizing” exoticism is unabashedly grounded in racist prejudice: <span class="quote">‘It would not be useless to remind [the reader] the notable likenesses that are drawn among Argentines and Arabs… Many of our customs reveal the contact of our fathers with the Moors from Andalusia. Let’s not even talk about physiognomies: I have met some Arabs who I swear I have seen in my country. (<em>Facundo</em> 28 n. without number; my translation)’</span> <span class="quote">‘[The attitudes of the <em>gaucho</em> people] have the same explanation in the planes as in Arab countries. Life in the desert … is one of privation, poverty, and monotony…The barbarian is bodily insensitive, as he is <em>less prompt to reflection, which is the faculty that dominates in the educated man</em>. (274–75, my translation, emphases added)’</span> <span class="quote">‘It is necessary to see those closed-bearded faces, those grave and serious countenances, such as in the Asian Arabs, to judge the compassionate disdain that inspires their contemplation of the sedentary man of the cities. (14, my translation) ’</span> Sarmiento’s depiction of countrymen and that of Orientalized subjects are one and the same. Within his social imaginary, Arabs and <em>gaucho</em> people represent closed-mindedness (“less prompt to reflection”) and non-urban backwardness. Certainly, Sarmiento’s internal contradictions deserve a more complex analysis than I am able to provide here.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note17" id="Note17_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>For this purpose, Noe Jitrik’s considerations of the internal contradictions of Facundo and Carlos Alonso’s examination of Sarmiento’s passionate incongruities are still relevant.</span></div></div> Yet, for the interests of my argument on the innovative character of <em>El Giaur</em>, it is striking that Zapata decided to publish and translate a story where those precise boundaries (Good-Evil, East-West) were forcibly blurred and problematized. Within the context of Sarmiento’s binary ideology, Zapata provides an indication of a more complex worldview, one in which the lines dividing <em>Civilization and Barbarism</em> are harder to grasp. Considering the later disagreements between both writers, Sarmiento and Zapata, it is possible to see in the publication of <em>El Giaur</em> a foreshadowing of their later differences.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4"><h2><span class="head">III. After Martín Zapata</span></h2><p>The consecration of <em>The Giaour</em> in the Spanish-speaking world as a major text in the Byronic canon would take time. Byron’s first Oriental poem was not translated again into Spanish until 1864, after almost another twenty years. Continuing the interest awakened by Zapata’s translation, Argentine poet Pedro Espinosa, known as “Espinillo,” took the responsibility of being the first to provide a versified rendition of <em>The Giaour</em>. Unfortunately, the little booklet did not achieve much attention and currently sits in the National Library of Buenos Aires, a testimony to the ephemeral attraction that this poem had in Argentina during the nineteenth century. From this point forward, interest in <em>The Giaour</em> would spark in other geographies. After a second translation in verse by José Núñez de Prado y Fernández (1824–1894) included in <em>Lord Byron: tres poemas puestos en verso castellano</em> (Spain, 1885), the tragic parable of the Greek Christian lover transformed into a vampire would resume his journey to Perú and Cuba. Almost concomitantly, two notable translators, José Arnaldo Márquez (Peru, 1832–1903) and Francisco Sellén (Cuba,1836–1907) issued the most notable renditions in verse to date of <em>The Giaour</em>. The individual efforts of Núñez, Márquez, and Sellén draw a new afterlife of the Byronic text, one in which translations from the original English source are conveyed through classical diction and meter (such as combinations of seven- and eleven-syllable lines), but with an unmistakable Gothic flair.</p><p>As Vicente Quirarte beautifully reminds us, “The Vampire cannot enter / unless we open the window” (
        “Elogio del vampiro”
      , lines 4–5; my translation). In the discontinuous life of <em>The Giaour</em> in the Spanish language, Martín Zapata signaled a moment of openness that not only spread a more comprehensive understanding of Lord Byron’s works, but also led to the acclimatization of the vampire and prose poetry in Latin America. Before the powerful vampiric stories by Horacio Quiroga, Rubén Darío, Julio Cortázar, and Carlos Fuentes, there was once <em>El Giaur o el infiel</em>, fathered by an almost forgotten Argentine writer. With the broad historical perspective that we hold today, we can see how Zapata’s rendition put in motion the interest in <em>The Giaour</em> and planted the seeds for the current cultivation of the vampire theme in contemporary Spanish and Latin American fiction. This article aimed at doing justice to his contribution, while underlining the subversiveness implicit in the timing of his publication. Within the stark coordinates of Argentine debates of the period, where little tolerance was given to ambiguity, Zapata’s choice carries a strong political stance. Today, as we read <em>El Giaur</em>, the same delightful chill that readers felt at the time comes back to us, to excite our fear and confront us with our prejudices once again.</p></div><div class="citation" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5"><h2><span class="head">Works Cited</span></h2><div class="biblfree">Abraham, Carlos. <em>La literatura fantástica argentina en el siglo XIX</em>.

Interestingly, the association between the English lord and vampire literature takes root very quickly in the Spanish language and constitutes a crucial factor of this early reception of Byron in the Hispanic world. In 1824, an editorial from Barcelona attributes the first Peninsular translation of Polidori’s <em>The Vampire</em> to Lord Byron. Within the Parisian editorial house of Librería Americana, this misattribution reoccurs in 1829, consolidating the vampiric mark as one of the main features of Byron’s writing during the first process of reception of his works.</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note5_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div><div class="note" id="Note6"><span class="noteLabel">6. </span><span class="noteBody">It must be noted that <em>The Giaour</em>’s vampiric transformation is merely shown though a prophecy and not in action.

Instead of proper translations, during this period we witness bastardized versions of the characters and main plot of <em>The Giaour</em> in Spain. The historical novel <em>Kar-Osman, Memorias de la Casa de Silva</em> (<em>Kar-Osman, Memories of the House of Silva</em>) by Ramón López Soler from 1832 (Picoche 91), and the poetic diptych

Remarkably, both writers obliterate any reference to the preternatural curse and vampiric transformation of the protagonist.

Fittingly, the drama’s publication in the early nineteenth century coincided not only with Rafael del Riego’s republican revolt in Spain but also with the independence movements throughout Latin America more generally.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

I focus my reading primarily on Alejo Carpentier’s <em>Los pasos perdidos</em> [<em>The Lost Steps</em>] (1950), a major twentieth-century novel whose network of references and allusions to Shelley’s play provides one of the most earnest artistic engagements with the drama ever produced. I ultimately suggest that as an endorsement of non-violent revolution and social equality, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> has been indelibly inscribed into the radical political and literary history of Spanish-American nations.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Given that Shelley did not expect <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> to be a popular work in English, its brief circulation and reception history in Hispanophone cultures is perhaps unsurprising.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

This initial scarcity of copies and readers seems to corroborate what Shelley claimed in his preface to the play that “[his] purpose has hitherto been simply to familiarize the highly refined imagination of the more select classes of poetical readers with beautiful idealisms of moral excellence” (209).</span></div></div> <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> was not <em>fully</em> translated into the Spanish language until 1994, when Hiperion Press in Spain published a bilingual edition with a translation by Alejandro Valero. The drama had hitherto appeared in translation in both Spain and Spanish America only in parts: as an array of fragments that existed as separate “poems” featured in anthologies. Excerpts of it had also been used as epigraphs or cited in works by authors such as Miguel de Unamuno, who considered Shelley to be a “marvelous” writer (González and Rodríguez 101).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

This is owing largely to the country’s complicated history. During the nineteenth century, for instance, Shelley was occluded from the “conservative attitudes” of the reign of Ferdinand VII (1784–1833), when several liberal, progressive authors, including Jose de Espronceda, were exiled from Spain—a time period that also coincided with the Spanish American Independence movements. It was not until the fin-de-siècle that [Shelley] is first mentioned in Spain. His name reappeared during the 1920s only to disappear soon thereafter with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1936 and the ensuing fascist state created under Francisco Franco. The name of Shelley and his work began reappearing in the 1970s and has continued to gain traction ever since; the recent translation of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is a good case in point (97).</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>In the two centuries since <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>’s publication, versions of it—as either a reference or part-translation in Spanish America—have taken on varying titles: <em>Prometeo</em> (Prometheus), <em>Prometeo Desencadenado</em> (Prometheus Unchained), <em>Prometeo Liberado</em> (Prometheus Liberated), <em>Prometeo Desatado</em> (the closest version one comes to “unbound” in Spanish), and <em>Prometeo Libertado</em> (an orthographical variation of Prometheus Liberated).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

The volume’s back cover, which functions as a preface to the collection, highlights the drama as “perhaps [Shelley’s] most ambitious work.” It traces some biographical information on Shelley and the play’s composition history prior to offering a synopsis that makes the case for the drama as a text of resistance (Figure 1): <figure class="figure"><img src="https://romantic-circles.org/sites/default/files/imported/praxis/latinam/images/omfig1Thumb.png" alt="Figure 1: Back Cover of Valero’s edition of Prometeo Liberado (1994, Hiperión Press)" class="noBox" style=" width:300px;" /></figure> <span class="quote">‘Grounded in Greek myth that [Shelley] interprets and reimagines according to his own style, [the play] brings fundamental problems into relief such as the struggle between good and evil and the origin and destiny of the human species who, alongside the natural world, resists oppression and destruction in the struggle for liberty. The poem ends with a great song of hope in the wake of love’s triumph as the law of the world. ’</span> In his editorial notes, Valero remarks how, in contrast to Aeschylus’s version of the myth, Shelley focused his adaptation on the moral and psychological aspects that enable Prometheus’s liberation (215). For Valero, the play’s portrayal of a new political reality culminates in a celebratory chant of freedom: <blockquote class="quote"><p class="noCount">The new world created by Prometheus’s liberation. The ancient world passes away and nature celebrates with joy the new state of things. The main actors in [the final] act are time and space.

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>An investigation into Herriot’s biography, including his letters and journals, did not reveal any connection to Shelley or his drama.</span></div></div> In addition to summarizing all four acts, Herriot lauds the play’s poetic ideals as both “current” and “eternal.” After citing the final lines uttered by Demogorgon in Act IV, he praises the play’s “luxuries of lyricism,” its ideas of passive resistance, and the “necessary agony” suffered by Prometheus. In the final paragraph, Herriot states: <span class="quote">‘I gladly read [<em>Prometheus Unbound</em>] again in these troublesome times. I have placed it among my beloved books, very close to Plato. Shelley is the poet of democracy, of reason, of intellectual beauty; [he is] the adversary of tyranny, the enthusiastic chanter of liberty. I love everything about its classic purity; the poetry that flows through all its parts, the immense love of nature that resounds in each of its stanzas, [and] the ineffable music of its verse. During the war’s tragic hours, I would hear [the play’s] words of hope, which sang in the wind of the battle. May [Shelley’s] memory rise again today among the lands of the free in order to inspire respect for life, the love of Reason and of Peace! After all, [Shelley] was the one who said: “Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world.”’</span> Employing his own poetic liberties and invoking Shelley’s famous description of poets as “unacknowledged legislators,” Herriot’s synopsis mirrors the earlier sentiments of W.B. Yeats, who famously said at the turn of the twentieth century that <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is among the “sacred books of the world” (<em>Early Essays</em> 70). Like Valero, Herriot acknowledges the drama’s timeless connections between poetry, politics, and popular reform.</p></div><p>This seemingly uncritical treatment of Shelley’s poetry and politics turns strikingly more nuanced in Carpentier’s reading of the play in <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>. Although Carpentier was born in Switzerland to French and Russian parents and was educated throughout Europe, he grew up in Cuba and identified as Cuban. He spent much of his life fascinated by music, becoming a musicologist and studying musical traditions of the Caribbean and South America. Carpentier fled Cuba in 1945 because of the threat his left-wing politics posed to Fulgencio Batista’s regime. While in exile he wrote the partly autobiographical work, <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, which was published in Venezuela thirty-one years after Herriot’s article. A novel with Shelleyan, Conradian, and Proustian resonances, it tells the story of an unnamed, spiritually-exhausted protagonist and narrator whose Prufrockian <em>malaise</em> puts him at odds with the modern world. The narrative’s idealization of the origins of the human species is pit starkly against the “missteps” of human progress—as seen in the novel’s contrast between the native customs of a South American primitive oral society and the contemporary world of European languages, literature, philosophy, and cultures. A musicologist in search of native musical instruments, the narrator travels from New York City through the Andes Mountains into the heart of the South American jungle where his arduous physical journey toward the center of the continent also represents a journey back in time. From the contemporary urban landscape into farmlands, primitive villages, and stone-age-like encampments, he discovers an Edenic oasis and refuge from modern civilization.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Throughout its pages, Carpentier integrates the plot, mystical settings, and idealistic aims of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> into its narrative space. Like the lyrical drama, the novel portrays the reversal of historical time.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>While Carpentier’s novel suggests it, in Prometheus Unbound, humans are not at fault for the woe that they must endure.</span></div></div> Yet this modern adaptation of Shelley’s work, which is set in a South American jungle instead of the Indian Caucasus, offers a more ambivalent take than Valero’s or Herriot’s. The novel critiques the structure and aims of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as the integration of the play becomes an experiment that ultimately fails. Carpentier’s empiricist approach for thinking through Shelley’s radical imperatives brings to light the incompatibility between the demands for real-world change and the conceptual blueprints for revolution that Shelley presumably left under-theorized.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p><em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is undoubtedly the most significant source text for <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, and its assimilation in the novel occurs in multiple ways. Carpentier introduces Shelley’s text early in the book when the narrator sees a copy of the lyrical drama in a New York City bookshop, which made him “forget the world of books” altogether (12).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">
            (7)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It is not made clear whether the narrator finds a print copy of only the play itself or the entire 1820 Prometheus Unbound volume that contained other poems, including
        “To a Skylark,”

        “Ode to the West Wind,”
       and
        “The Sensitive Plant.”
      </span></div></div> This influential moment cues the reader to the currency of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> as the novel’s major touchstone, while prompting the narrator to recall his own musical adaptation of Shelley’s drama. He has, in fact, composed “a prelude and the first draft of the opening scenes” of an “ambitious cantata on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>,” a choral composition that emulates the style of the hymnic fourth act of Shelley’s play (19). The novel further resembles its predecessor text through its plot structure as a quest romance, its emphasis on social revolution, and its panoply of images and poetic descriptions.</p></div><p>The novel’s treatment of free love is also definitively Shelleyan. While married to Ruth, an American woman, the narrator has sought out a French lover named Mouche, with whom he travels to South America. When he grows tired of her during their journey, increasingly identifiying Mouche with Western bourgeois culture, he trades her for Rosario, a native woman and kindred spirit. These polyamorous behavioral patterns are reminiscent of Shelley’s own pursuits of love and depictions in such poems as <em>Epipsychidion</em>. For the narrator, Rosario transcends the taints of European modernity and colonialism and is the closest he comes to discovering his soulmate, his epipsyche: “several races had met in this [ideal] woman”; she is “an amalgam of related peoples” as an interracial and multi-ethnic ideal (81–2). “Through her lips the plants began to speak and describe their own powers,” which is suggestive of the animistic and anthropomorphic features of Shelley’s play (83). Carpentier even includes a moment of homoerotic tension when Mouche unsuccessfully attempts a pass at Rosario. This moment echoes the homoerotic scene between the daughters of Ocean at the beginning of Act II, as Carpentier meticulously aligns the plot and characters of each work.</p><p>In terms of setting, the urban landscapes of New York City and the guerilla-torn South American city parallel the unredeemed Earth of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>’s first act. These correspondences make evident that, for the narrator, both European metropoles and colonial peripheries have become contaminated and corrupted. Several lines from Act I, including those from Prometheus’s opening monologue, appear throughout this early part of the novel; the second chapter even begins with the first fury’s initial line, “Ha! I scent life,” which signals a point of transition for the Titan who, despite being persecuted and tormented by the goddesses, refuses to despair. When the narrator visits what scholars agree is Caracas, he experiences his own form of encounter with the taunting furies: the outbreak of a violent revolution and guerilla warfare in which snipers detain him against his will. In Caracas, even nature appears to be up in arms: “For hundreds of years a struggle had been going on with roots that pushed up the sidewalks and cracked the walls” (38). The scene recalls the tension that verges on stalemate between Prometheus and Jupiter, especially when the narrator comments on the fraught South American history of the twentieth century where one finds the “movement of Socialists against Conservatives, of Communists against Catholics . . . [and] one lives with Rousseau and the Inquisition, with the Immaculate Conception and Das Kapital” (50–1). The echoes from the first act of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> are further reinforced when the narrator passes a shop with a “mysterious sign,” “[el] Rastro de Zoroastro,” a rhymed Spanish phrase meaning the trail (or trace) of Zoroaster (42). The sign brings to mind Shelley’s own reference to Zoroaster in Act I, which reveals the play’s interest in critiquing institutionalized religions and dualistic structures.</p><p>Through a series of trials, the narrator also undertakes a quest romance into the heart of a jungle untainted by European civilization and colonization. The expedition echoes not only Prometheus’s mental transformation in Act I but also Asia’s quests in Act II: her physical journey into the underworld and the figurative voyage into the depths and discovery of her own psyche. Although both texts take place in different epochs and different parts of the globe, the characters in <em>Los pasos perdidos</em> encounter settings familiar to any reader of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>: frozen landscapes, ravines, volcanoes, and a “multitude of peaks and abysses” (78). Like Asia at the beginning of Act II, scene five, who appears on a cloud atop a mountain ready to redeem the earth with love alongside Prometheus, the narrator also finds himself positioned above the clouds just prior to his new life in the jungle beside his own ideal love, Rosario.</p><p>To engage Shelley’s work even further, Carpentier employs a style of imagery as if taken directly from the play’s experimental fourth act. Describing what he calls the “dance of the trees,” the narrator notes “the rhythm that begins in the leaves, a restless, ascending rhythm—with the surge and breaking of the waves, with gentle pauses, rests—which suddenly becomes a storm of rejoicing. There is nothing more beautiful than a bamboo thicket dancing in the breeze” (211). In Act IV, the Chorus of Unseen Spirits decree how: </p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">Bright clouds float in heaven,</div><div class="l">Dew-stars gleam on earth,</div><div class="l">Waves assemble on ocean,</div><div class="l">They are gathered and driven</div><div class="l">By the storm of delight, by the panic of glee!</div><div class="l">They shake with emotion,</div><div class="l">They dance in their mirth.</div><div class="indent2">(lines 40–46)</div></div></blockquote><p> Later, the chorus rejoices to “weave the dance on the floor of the breeze, / [and] Pierce with song heaven's silent light” (70–71).</p><p>Beyond embedding these ecstatic images into his poetical prose, Carpentier links the journey through space (to the center of the continent) to an expedition back in time. Upon his arrival at the secluded village, he remarks how he has retrogressed several millennia: <span class="quote">‘the 58 centuries separating the fourth chapter of Genesis from the current year <em>back there</em> could be spanned in one hundred and eighty minutes . . . [we flew] over cities that today, at this very time, belonged to the Middle Ages, the Conquest, the Colony, or the Romantic era” (233–34).’</span> For the narrator, the gap he once understood between the past and present has collapsed, as the self-sustaining community he has reached seemingly exists outside of history. Carpentier pits the Edenic surroundings of “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">acá</span>” (here) against the “<span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">allá</span>” (back there) of everyday modern life in New York and Caracas. The native village has bypassed the ravages of time and “progress” altogether; it is a “world compact, complete . . . a hidden nation, a map in code, a vast vegetable kingdom with few entrances” (126). Surrounded by native life and customs, the narrator experiences “the years . . . melt away, vanish, in the dizzying backward flight of time . . . We are in the Paleolithic age” (177–79). This part of the narrative is no doubt an adaptation of the final lines of the second act, in which Prometheus’s and Asia’s feats have reset history and have hence returned the world back to its origins: </p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">We have passed Age's icy caves,</div><div class="l">And Manhood's dark and tossing waves,</div><div class="l">And Youth's smooth ocean, smiling to betray:</div><div class="l">Beyond the glassy gulfs we flee</div><div class="l">Of shadow-peopled Infancy,</div><div class="l">Through Death and Birth, to a diviner day</div><div class="indent2">(II.v.98–103)</div></div></blockquote><p> It is no coincidence that, in the midst of living in the native community, the narrator mentions his “old plan” of working on <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>, as he delights in being part of a primitive oral society that is centered on community, memory, and literature. He learns “that the Indians had preserved the memory of a confused epic . . . of a Carib migration . . . [through which] the amazing unity of myths was borne out . . . the poem lived in the memory of the generations of the jungle” (210). The passage recalls Shelley’s own heterogeneous and eclectic myth of global aspiration. A play that symbolically unites the West (Prometheus) and East (Asia), <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is itself a “confused epic” that bridges numerous traditions, faiths, and cultures.</p><p>This ostensibly uncritical homage to Shelley’s drama starts to dwindle, however, toward the end of the novel. While enjoying his new jungle life and using language and imagery inspired by the Shelleyan imagination, the narrator appears to lose touch with the actual details of the play. As he recounts, <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> for him <span class="quote">‘conveyed a sense of resurrection, an emergence from darkness . . . Certain verses I recalled would have fitted in admirably with my desire to work on <em>a text made of simple and direct words</em>: ‘Ah me! Alas, pain, pain, pain ever, for ever!’—‘No change, no pause, no hope! Yet I endure.’ And then those choruses of mountains, springs, storms, elements by which I was surrounded and I felt. That voice of the Earth, at once Mother, clay, womb, like the Mothers of Gods who still reign in the jungle. And those hounds of hell who break into the drama and howl with the accent of maenads rather than furies. ‘Ha! I scent life!’ ‘Let me but look into his eyes!’” (166, emphasis added)’</span> Notwithstanding the narrator’s (and Carpentier’s) palpable admiration for the drama, any careful reader of Shelley’s play will detect the blatant misreading. Most obviously, the language of <em>Prometheus Unbound</em> is neither simple nor direct. Nor are the furies represented in Act I as agents of Dionysus. In an unusual manner, the above lines interweave the fantastical aspects of Shelley’s drama with the narrator’s inaccurate recollection of it.</p><p>Yet these are not careless mistakes on Carpentier’s part. The mischaracterization of Shelley’s work arrives at a fitting point in the novel when the narrator stops idealizing the South American natives and landscape. This transformation is signaled most pointedly and symbolically by the appearance of a copy of Homer’s <em>The Odyssey</em>. Snapping out of Shelleyan fantasy, the narrator regains his “modern” consciousness. “But no,” he confesses, “it was absurd to excite my imagination with [the cantata] when I did not have Shelley’s poem there, and never would” (218). At this climactic juncture, rather than resuming that “misbegotten Prelude to <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>,” he decides instead to compose a cantata on <em>The Odyssey</em> (218). That is, the spell cast by Shelley’s poetry is broken, as the turn to Homeric epic foreshadows not only the end of the narrator’s sojourn in paradise but also his imminent return home to New York.</p><p>It is appropriate at this point in the novel that—as in the case with the regeneration of the earth in <em>Prometheus Unbound</em>—veils and masks suddenly “fall.” Let us recall that, at the end of Act III, the Spirit of the Hour declares: </p><blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">The painted veil, by those who were, called life,</div><div class="l">Which mimicked, as with colours idly spread,</div><div class="l">All men believed or hoped, is torn aside;</div><div class="l"><em>The loathsome mask has fallen</em>, the man remains</div><div class="l">Sceptreless, free, uncircumscribed, but man</div><div class="l">Equal, unclassed, tribeless, and nationless,</div><div class="l">Exempt from awe, worship, degree, the king</div><div class="l">Over himself;</div><div class="indent2">(III.iv.190–97, emphasis added)</div></div></blockquote><p> When the characters in the play report that masks and veils have fallen, they mean that the regenerated earth has shed the unnatural distortions caused by tyranny and corruption—allowing thus a view of things as they really are. In <em>Los pasos perdidos</em>, however, Carpentier transforms the ends of the Shelleyan trope. Rather than highlighting the illusions generated by a tainted world, the fallen veils seemingly betray the pitfalls of Shelley’s play. This can be detected when, feeling like an intruder, the narrator suspects he “had torn the veil” of the primitive society (203). While he understands that he has reached a “primordial sense of beauty . . . in such remoteness” (163)—a landscape “unshaken since prehistoric times” (165)—Carpentier, unlike Shelley, ceases to depict nature as idealized. In the jungle, beauty stands beside coarseness: a “slimy tangle of snakes,” “rampant fauna,” and “primeval slime” (160–61). The narrator experiences “a kind of disorientation, and dizziness of the eyes . . . a [feeling] of being completely lost” within such a wilderness (161). This passage is reminiscent of the dizzying and intoxicating haze that overwhelms Asia during her descent toward Demogorgon, especially with echoes of the
        “Life of Life”
       hymn from the second act’s fifth scene. But, unlike Asia, who releases Demogorgon through her proto-psychoanalytic introspection, the narrator believes himself to be an interloper in the prelapsarian landscape: “We were intruders, ignorant outlanders . . . in a city born in the dawn of History” (179). He unmasks, as it were, the Shelleyan fantasy and reconsiders the value of returning to one’s alleged origins: “If we go back a little farther, we will come to the terrible loneliness of the Creator, the . . . sadness of the times without incense or songs of praise, when the earth was without order and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep” (187). Surviving in this “prenatal world” becomes impossible, as the narrator is incapable of reconciling the disjunction between the primitive and modern worlds (206).</p><div class="wrapper"><p>The narrator’s retreat from the South American cradle of civilization, then, abruptly brings Carpentier’s Shelleyan experiment to its end. Despite the jungle’s allure of art, poetry, seclusion, and exile, as well as his “irresistible” desire to finish his Shelleyan cantata, he remembers the lack of paper and other modern tools that have deterred him from figuratively turning back those “58 centuries” (206). Like Prometheus, he recants, retracting his original desires of remaining in paradise. Unlike Prometheus, though, he ultimately decides to return <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">allá</span> to New York City. When the narrator boards a plane that arrived in search of him, he abandons Rosario and the Shelleyan imagination alike. Carpentier magnifies the tension at this moment by drawing one final time upon Shelley’s poetry. During takeoff, the narrator discovers “an opalescent mist . . . [that] cut us off from everything . . . a fleecy bank of clouds” (238–39).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

In his tribute to and admiration for Shelley’s lyrical drama, Carpentier’s profound engagement with the text also brings the pitfalls of the utopian drama into relief. For, at least through the novel’s depiction of the modern era of bourgeois capitalism, there exists neither a redeeming Demogorgon nor a cosmic celebration of perpetual harmony. The secluded and intimate South American jungle is not, after all, like Asia's and Prometheus's cave of artistic cultivation, which sustains the renovated universe. According to Carpentier’s conclusion, this alternate prelapsarian South American space must remain elusive: contained instead in hearts of darkness, chasms and caves of wonder, obscure volumes, and even unfinished cantatas.</p></section><section class="citation" id="index.xml-body.1_div.2"><header><h1><span class="head">Works Cited</span></h1></header><div class="biblfree">Almeida, Joselyn M.

A member of the Generation of '27, Cernuda left Madrid in 1938 to deliver lectures at Oxford and Cambridge, traveling to Glasgow, Cambridge, London, and the United States before finally settling in Mexico. As an exile in Scotland and England, Cernuda encounters Romanticism in the midst of the Modernist rejection of the era, negotiating questions of poetical ethics and pertinence during an era of modern warfare. Reading <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and echoing Shelley a century later, he asks, “What is a poet?” “Poetry is not only useful,” Cernuda decides, “but also has certain social effects.” This essay offers an encompassing view of how Cernuda achieved a sense of unity in his own poetics, negotiating an English tradition with a Spanish one, while balancing his Romantic interests against contemporary Modernist pressures.</p></section></div><!--TEI body--><div class="tei_body"><section class="essay" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><header><h1><span class="head">Toward Unity: Cernuda and English Romanticism</span></h1></header><div class="byline"><span class="docAuthor">Gabriel Insausti</span> <br xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" />University of Navarra, Spain</div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1"><h2><span class="head">The Fruit of Exile</span></h2><p>Luis Cernuda arrived in Great Britain in March 1938, with the lure of a series of lectures that the poet Stanley Richardson had promised to organize for him to escape the dangers of the Spanish Civil War. He remained in Glasgow until 1943, in Cambridge until 1945, and in London until 1947, whereupon he made his way to Massachusetts, always working in educational and university institutions. His stay in these English-speaking countries would be extremely fruitful: during this time the poet wrote numerous essays, several volumes of poems, a collection of short stories, and two books of prose poems (<em>Ocnos</em> and <em>Variaciones sobre tema mexicano</em>).</p><div class="wrapper"><p>The first thing the years spent in England gave to Cernuda was his knowledge of the English language.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>According to testimonies of his years in Glasgow, his English skills were underdeveloped. However, it is fair to assume that with time, and despite his shyness, Cernuda's linguistic skills in this language improved.</span></div></div> A glance at the texts written during his exile allow the reader to recognize a loss of familiarity with the natural turn of phrases in oral Spanish. His grammatical constructions abound in unusual expressions and anastrophes and it is very common to find in his writings the use of Anglicisms and linguistic loans. A second element to be highlighted is the choice of reading materials. During his first stay at Cranleigh School, Cernuda began to read Shakespeare, Blake, Keats, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Housman. Along with the Bible and the Spanish Golden Age classics, the English poets would always be present in his personal library. A third component acquired as a result of the years spent in England and the United States was the opportunity to engage in the translation of canonic works of the English literary tradition. Cernuda undertook the translation of two sonnets by Wordsworth,
        “The Definition of Love”
       by Marvell,
        “A Toccata of Gallupi’s”
       by Browning,
        “Byzantium”
       by Yeats, and <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> by Shakespeare. There are also indications that he was able to translate Shelley’s <em>A Defence of Poetry</em> and Blake’s <em>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</em>. Finally, it must also be mentioned that he was able to acquire many of the aesthetic criteria and tools for engaging in literary criticism, a task that Cernuda cultivated profusely. Dryden, Johnson, Coleridge and Arnold—names that are also considered by T.S. Eliot among the most eminent literary critics—are some of the critics that he mentions most often in his writings.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Of course, the critic to whom Cernuda probably paid most attention was Eliot himself, towards whom he harbored mixed feelings. On the one hand he admired his poetry but, on the other, he lost a certain impartiality in his judgment when his own verses were rejected from Eliot’s <em>Faber &amp; Faber</em> collection.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The essay
        “Goethe and Mr. Eliot,”
       for instance, could be read as a direct attack on Eliot. This essay is a direct rebuttal to Eliot’s Goethe, or the Sage (1959). Cernuda also openly contradicts Eliot in
        “Baudelaire en el centenario de Las flores del mal”
       (1959). However, the importance of Eliot as the central point of English criticism for Cernuda is undeniable: all the references made by Cernuda in his texts (Herbert Read, I. A. Richards, Lord Houghton, Middleton Murry, Lowes, etc.) match those listed in Eliot’s The Use of Poetry and the Use of Criticism and On…</span></div></div> In this regard it should not be forgotten that Cernuda’s stay in Great Britain coincides with a moment of definitive recognition for Eliot: the last years of <em>The Criterion</em>, his beginnings in theater with the successful <em>Murder in the Cathedral</em>, etc. and with the conclusive backing of the Nobel Prize. In fact, I believe that at least three features of Eliot’s critique attracted Cernuda’s approval: the thesis of
        “Tradition and Individual Talent”
      , according to which tradition is not inherited “naturally,” which was the criterion that had guided Cernuda himself during his formative years and had led him to expand his reading and to learn languages; the Eliotian “correlative objective” that Cernuda translates as “equivalente correlativo” in <em>Historial de un libro</em>; and the idea that the only legitimate critic is the poet himself, which was recognizably and perfectly embodied in Eliot. In any case, there is no doubt that these years, and especially those spent in England, left their mark on Cernuda. “Perhaps my stay there,” he would write to Edward Wilson from America, “has been the richest phase of my life so far, if not as a mold first, then as a refinement of what I took there with me."<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

That being said, what did the poet “bring with him” when he arrived in England? What readings, teachings or references are to be found in his poetry from 1927 to 1938? It can be said that his trajectory prior to exile was a kind of journey against the current of time: he moved from the purism of <em>Perfil del aire</em> (1927) to the surrealism of <em>Un río, un amor</em> (1929) and <em>Los placeres prohibidos</em> (1931); from there he shifted towards to the Becquerian Romanticism of <em>Donde habite el olvido</em> (1933) and, finally, geared in the direction of the great European Romanticism, with the watchword of a neo-paganism inherited from the <em>Greek Revival</em> under the guidance of Hölderlin, in <em>Invocaciones</em> (1935). In other words, our poet was already part of a Romantic family tree on the eve of his departure for England.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>The starting point of that Romanticism—a consequence and a response to eighteenth-century rationalism—was the drama of the splitting of consciousness and the thirst for unity. Hölderlin exclaimed at the beginning of his <em>Hyperion</em> that the highest human aspiration was “to be one with all that is alive, to return to the whole of nature” (25), while Wordsworth encoded in his “<em>Aeolian visitations</em>” a hint of participation in the <em>Spirit of Nature</em> which he reveals in <em>The Prelude</em>. In <em>Palabras antes de una lectura</em> (1935), Cernuda gives an account of his beginnings in poetry: <span class="quote">‘The poetic instinct awakened in me with the sharpest perception of reality, experiencing, with a deep impact, the beauty and attraction of the surrounding world. Its effect was, somewhat similarly to what happens with the desire that love produces, the painful and intense necessity to rise up out of myself, drowning in that vast body of creation. What made this desire even more agonizing was the tacit recognition of its impossible satisfaction. (<em>Prosa I</em> 602)<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">
            (4)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All translations from Spanish by Gabriel Insausti.</span></div></div>’</span> I believe that with a touch of Freudian language (the urgency of artistic creation as the sublimation of eroticism, the “desire for death” as the path to reintegration into unity), it is easy to recognize in these words the same melancholy that moved Hölderlin and Wordsworth: the urge for communion with nature and the loss of a Kantian lost paradise of immediacy. That is to say, that poetic writing would have in its origin the ascertainment of this rift and would consist of an attempt (inevitably frustrated, suggests Cernuda) to suture it. Poetry, once wrote Novalis, heals the wounds that philosophy inflicts.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>If we look closely at this narrative of the origins, the Romantic affiliation clearly reappears. In <em>Historial de un libro</em> (1958), for example, Cernuda refers to the first time he was pushed to write poetry: during his military service he went out on horseback around the outskirts of Seville every afternoon, and during one of these excursions “things appeared to me as if I were seeing them for the first time, as if I were entering and communicating with them for the first time, and this unusual vision, simultaneously provoked in me an expressive urgency, the urgency to tell of this experience” (<em>Prosa I</em> 626). That was the same attitude that Coleridge had envisioned in his <em>Biographia Literaria</em>, and also that of Wordsworth in his <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> (1798), where this latter explains that the purpose of poetry was “to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind’s attention from the lethargy of custom,” which prevents us from seeing everything anew. In short, this Romantic theorization of poetry would be an intimation of the concept of “defamiliarization” that formalist criticism would erect as the cornerstone of literary writing. However, as Cernuda had already said, this attempt to take over the world by word of mouth was invariably bound to frustration: <span class="quote">‘I began to distinguish a simultaneous and opposite current within me: towards reality and against reality, of attraction and hostility towards what is real. Desire led me to the reality that offered itself before my eyes, as if only by its possession could I attain certainty about my own life. But like that possession I have never reached it except in a precarious way, hence the opposite current of hostility to the ironic attraction of reality. (<em>Prosa I</em> 602)’</span> Hence, from this conflict, the title that presides over all his poetic work: <em>La realidad y el deseo</em>. Again, a further development of Romanticism: the inescapable tantalizing frustration in which Schopenhauer’s thought ends up. It is not surprising to find that this expression of isolated subjectivity is expressed through allegory. On this topic Philip Silver has observed that allegory is the means by which isolated subjectivity with the environment and nature is usually featured, given that—unlike the language of the symbols—it presupposes a pause, a disjunction (
        “Hacia”
      ). Finally, this Romanticism had closed ranks around a fundamental idea, that of imagination. This dimension appears as an alternative to a scientific vision of the world, characteristic of the eighteenth-century mentality. It is science that Hölderlin accuses of “having ruined everything,” and it is through it that the poet has learned “to differentiate myself fundamentally from what surrounds me, […] I have thus been expelled from the garden of nature” (26). Wordsworth expresses this idea memorably in
        “The Tables Turned”
      : <blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">Sweet is the lore which Nature brings;</div><div class="l">Our meddling intellect</div><div class="l">Misshapes the beauteous forms of things</div><div class="l">We murder to dissect (lines 25–28; 103).</div></div></blockquote> With its analytical impulse and its proliferation of distinctions, science would thus be reduced to a “scrutiny” of the physical world.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">
            (5)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>In fact, when in The Prelude, Wordsworth apostrophes his friend Coleridge (to whom the poem as a whole was dedicated), he does so with very particular praise: ...to theeScience appears but what in truth is,Not as our glory and our absolute boast,But as a succedaneum, and a propTo our infirmity. No officious slave5Art thou of that false secondary powerBy which we multiply distinctions [...]To thee, unblinded by these formal arts,The unity of all hath been revealed. (Book II, 211–222)</span></div></div> Against the inanimate mechanism, Wordsworth would pursue a personal and unitary experience of nature, in which something remains unobtainable through mere analysis. This idea of <em>natura naturans</em> and its correlation to the imagination as an invisible link between nature and the poet’s soul appears in the <em>Ocnos</em> poem meaningfully entitled
        “La naturaleza,”
       where Cernuda recalls a child’s proximity to the natural environment: <span class="quote">‘What a joy when I saw the leaves break at last, and their tender color, which by force of transparency almost seemed luminous, accentuating the raised veins, darkened little by little with the strongest sap. I felt as if He himself had worked the miracle of life, of awakening on the fundamental earth, such a god, the form previously dormant in the dream of the non-existent. (<em>Poesía Completa</em> 554)’</span> This passage resonates with the Rousseauian mythology of childhood as well as with Wordsworth’s idea of <em>vision and faculty divine</em>, whose purest expression lies in that of a child's gaze. It is only that this participation in the intimacy of nature takes place in the past perfect and in the third person, as if the poet were inescapably distancing himself from an experience he can no longer share, in a melancholic suggestion. In any case, if Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley and Keats agreed on something, over and above the nominalist differences, it was in vindicating that the queen among the faculties, imagination, is capable of glimpsing a reality superior to everyday life. Cernuda, who revels the Romantic imagination as the source of the “individualistic attitude” and the “supremacy of the spirit” characteristic of Romantic poets (<em>Prosa I</em> 271–72), is very close to this Romantic idea when he affirms that the essence of the poetic problem “is the conflict between reality and desire, between appearance and truth, permitting us to achieve some glimpse of the complete image of the world that we do not know, of the ‘divine idea of the world that lies at the bottom of the appearance,’ according to Fichte’s phrase” (<em>Prosa I</em> 602). On the other hand, on the marginal nature of this task, (the historic defeat of the Romantic amendment to the unilateralities of enlightened rationalism), our poet is not fooled: “Modern society, unlike those that preceded it, has decided to dispense with the inseparable mysterious element of life. Unable to explore it, society prefers to pretend not to believe in its existence. But the poet cannot proceed in this way and must count on that area of shadow and fog in life that floats around human bodies” (<em>Prosa I</em> 602–4). The Cernudian melancholy therefore exudes a quality that places it unequivocally in the tradition of high European Romanticism. It also places it on the path of some sort of “reactionary” or anti-modern trend: despite the attempt of modern scientificism to “disenchant” the world—according to Weber, and later to Adorno and Horkheimer—the mystery in life remains. And that means that the ultimate truth cannot be grasped through reason, but through imagination.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.3"><h2><span class="head">The Underlying Fire</span></h2><p>It is worth making a few comments on the significance of this Cernudian reception of English Romanticism. First, we must remember the obvious fact that Spanish Romanticism had historically been very weak and had not produced any noteworthy poet. This would make of Cernuda a sort of “late-yielding fruit,” apparently inactive in an outdated rhetoric, if it were not for his ability to recover elements of that rhetoric in order to build a relevant discourse. Secondly, it should be noted that at the time of this reception, Romanticism had been “dismissed” in the English literary officialdom, due to the anti-Romantic tirades that Pound, Eliot, and <em>modernism</em> in general had launched against the Wordsworthian tradition since the war years, in order to displace some Georgians who were contemplating the exhaustion of that tradition. Thirdly, when Cernuda assimilated the reading of the English Romantic poets, he did not take into account the revision that began with <em>The Mirror and the Lamp</em> (1953) by M. H. Abrams. He could not have read either—as they were yet to be produced—the later interpretations of Paul de Man, Geoffrey Hartmann, and Harold Bloom.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>The Cernudian reading of Romanticism dealt with authors and works that had been subject to prejudice for decades. This was the case, for instance of the Victorian dilemma between the aesthetes, Wilde, Pater, Rossetti, etc., and moralists such as Carlyle, Arnold, and Morris, who tended to assimilate the Romantic legacy to the first group in a biased vision that amputated the Romantic message to the point of denaturing it. This was a dualism that, as Raymond Williams observed, was the result of the false image of the Romantic artist as an isolated aesthete in his individual solipsism (30).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
            (6)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>A brief inspection is enough to refute this: Blake introduced criticisms of labor exploitation and racism in his Songs of Innocence, developed a summary examination of his own homeland in The Daughters of Albion, and proclaimed revolution in America; Wordsworth incorporated his autobiographical account of the march of European civilization in the chapters on the French Revolution included in The Prelude; Coleridge went beyond the subject of defending rural life in poems such as
        “This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison”
       or
        “Frost at Midnight”
      ; he expressed his disappoint…</span></div></div> Obviously, this dualism is indebted to the language of the Romantics themselves: think of Wordsworth and Coleridge’s fancy and imagination; or think of Coleridge’s distinction between reason and understanding; or think of the antagonism between reason and imagination in Keats’s
        “Letters”
      ; or think of the all-pervading logics of dialectics in Blake, with the constant struggle of Los and Urizen. How could Cernuda cope with that?</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>The first half of the essay
        “Pensamiento poético en la lírica inglesa del siglo XIX”
       suggests that, according to Cernuda, the temperament and "metaphysical position" of these poets is only understood against the background of industrialization and rural exodus (and also, of course, in the context of the English empiricist tradition). His particular judgment on them confirms it: in Cernuda’s opinion, “the ethical intention is evident in Wordsworth” (<em>Prosa I</em> 295), while in Blake there would be a mystic and a revolutionary that our poet relates to the figures of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard. Thus, far from sterile aestheticism or inane escapism, Romanticism could have an outcome in the form of civil responsibility. In <em>Río vespertino</em> Cernuda states this in unmistakably Romantic terms when he declares that <blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">sueño no es lo que al poeta ocupa,</div><div class="l">más la verdad oculta, como el fuego</div><div class="l">subyacente en la tierra.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

Contrary to what the doctrines of the engaged artist proclaimed in the twentieth century, Cernuda’s civil responsibility did not opt for a dissolution of individuality. The task of challenging individualism, which in Byron or Shelley could reach the theatrical, was only the starting point of the Romantic program. Cernuda seems to remember this criterion when he writes in
        “La visita de Dios”
       that <blockquote class="quote"><div class="stanza"><div class="l">por mi dolor comprendo que otros inmensos sufren</div><div class="l">hombres callados a quienes falta el ocio</div><div class="l">para arrojar al cielo su tormento.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

        “Palabras antes de una lectura”
       he had already suggested this privileged (but responsible) place of the poet: <span class="quote">‘What can the poet do for himself? Never before has society reduced life to such narrow limits. Certainly, the poet is almost always a revolutionary, at least I believe he is; a revolutionary who, like other men, lacks freedom, but who, unlike them, cannot accept this imprisonment and who runs into the walls of his prison countless times. (<em>Prosa I</em> 603)’</span> Poetry, in short, could constitute a sort of <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">ultima ratio</span>, and the poet would be characterized as a being defeated beforehand by the practical world that of mere efficiency, capitalism and <em>Realpolitik</em>. Moreover, Cernuda goes so far as to claim that in expressing man’s reaction to survive in a society where there is no room for him, Blake and Wordsworth would be, even before Baudelaire, the first modern poets. Against this state of affairs (that of “reality”), Cernuda opposes an ethical affirmation, that of “desire,” which is once again Romantic, in the tributes to the figure of the literary hero contained in poems such as
        “F. G. L,”

        “A Larra, con unas violetas,”
       and
        “Góngora”
       among others. In these texts, the poet is shown in constant confrontation with a hostile environment and political dissatisfaction would form part of his case. "Poetry is not only useful," Cernuda deduces from Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>, "but also has certain social effects" (<em>Prosa I</em> 333). This is not to say that our poet is in favor of <em>all</em> the Romantic pronouncements in this sense, and in his reluctance we can see the shadow of the problems and the embarrassment that imprisoned the writer of the twentieth century—fundamentally, the urgency of taking sides but the reticence to a compromise that reduced his voice to a watchword. On Shelley, Cernuda observes that the primacy of action can be guessed in him, and only when this latter failed did the English poet make up his mind to use his forces differently—that is, in an exercise of writing that would be characterized as a substitute for real political activity. The result is a poetic theory that borders on propaganda, as can be seen in the letter to Thomas Love Peacock—written in Naples on January 26th 1819—, which Cernuda mentions: “I consider poetry,” Shelley said there, “to be very subordinate to morality and political science” (Shelley quoted by Cernuda 501). Despite the Victorian caricature, the poetics of political <em>engagement</em> were sometimes not too far from the Romantic sensibility. In fact, the Romantic poets were very often on the verge of preaching such a doctrine. And Cernuda, long before Williams stressed on this aspect, was quite right to underline the moral and political implications of some of these poems.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Interestingly, this recovery of the ethical and political aspect of Romanticism had reached a remarkable milestone during Cernuda’s English years. In 1937 Stephen Spender—whom our poet met in a slightly unpleasant appointment recounted by Rafael Martínez Nadal (86–90)—published a book entitled <em>Forward from Liberalism</em> (1937). What was Spender’s proposal? Between the “anti-heroic” myth of Auden’s generation and the new political urgency caused by the rise of fascism, which would lead Harry Pollitt to wish that with his trip to a Spain at war he would become “a new Byron,” Spender advocated for a development of the Romantic program. In his opinion, this program had been fenced in; it promoted social justice and an idea of the role of the writer that returned to Shelley's famous phrase that poets are "prophets" and "the unacknowledged legislators of the world."<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note9" id="Note9_return"><sup class="super">

What I want to highlight is that this consideration of Romanticism in all its breadth allows us to resolve the traditional dualism between the “Edenist” interpretation of the Cernudian work (the one defended by Philip Silver, according to which its fundamental meaning, with the “thirst for eternity” as the “unifying theme” (<em>Luis Cernuda</em> 48), corresponds to the Romantic argument of the expulsion from paradise) and the “ethicist” argument (the one fundamentally advocated by Derek Harris (13–14), for whom, as time goes by, there is a distancing "from the Romantic vision of the world" in Cernuda). Why? Because, although it is true that the Edenist thesis (the evocation of paradise, and the longing and the search for restitution, even if vicarious, through writing) is almost exclusively based on <em>Ocnos</em> and a few poems from <em>La realidad y el deseo</em>, if one considers Romanticism in all its aspects, as I have proposed here, the critical attitude is not excluded from the characterization of the Cernudian character as "Romantic." On the other hand, Paz's idea that our poet is "one of the few moralists that Spain has given," but a moralist "who tests the systems of collective morality" (116), fits perfectly into this model, which would provide a channel for Cernuda's temperamental individualism. Of course, the idea of "spiritual biography" that accompanies the ethicist thesis would be perfectly congruent with a Romanticism that, far from the symbolist ideal of full autonomy, always preserves a knot between the poet and the poem.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.4"><h2><span class="head">Toward a Poetic Theory of Unity</span></h2><div class="wrapper"><p>How does this Cernudian Romanticism manifest in the poems? Of course, it is not difficult to recognize in many moments of <em>La realidad y el deseo</em> an openly Romantic iconography:
        “Las ruinas”
       and
        “Otras ruinas”
       recreate a motif already used by Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley;
        “El arpa”
       obviously invites one to think of
        “The Eolian Harp”
       by Coleridge and in Shelley’s <em>Defence</em>; the blackbird of
        “Río vespertin”
       whose fate is “purer than that of man” seems to be inherited directly from the nightingales of Coleridge and Keats, from Shelley’s lark and from Wordsworth’s redbreast, and also reissues an eminently Romantic theme such as the affirmation of the superiority of nature over art (Poesía Completa 371);
        “Violetas,”
       where the spiked flowers are for a moment “norma para lo efímero que es bello” and “vivo embeleso en la memoria,” introduces the theme of anticipating the memory of Wordsworth’s famous
        “Daffodils;”

        “El cementerio”
       and
        “Otro cementerio”
       recall the Romantic reflections raised by Gray’s memorable
        “Elegy.”
       I would, however, like to look at other aspects of the Cernudian writings perhaps less striking or recognizable, but also less anecdotal, insofar as they inform the whole of his poetry of exile. To observe them (and to read in them a poetry of that longed-for Romantic unity), one needs only to reread
        “Cementerio en la ciudad,”
       one of the poems from the Glasgow period, about the place known as
        “The Necropolis”

Cernuda takes up this doctrine with no less constancy: in
        “Tres poetas metafísicos”
       he warns that the predominance of wit was “a primary condition and instrument of imaginative creation” in seventeenth-century Spanish “conceptismo,” and that “under such a weight of associations the unique reality that the word supposes disappears as something annoying and useless” (<em>Prosa I</em> 512). The verbal fireworks would have an irritating effect that subtracts their substantial reality from things. Hence the accusation of a “wit game” that Cernuda launches against Salinas and, in general, against much of the Spanish tradition. In the face of the rapid and startling succession of parts, Cernuda stressed the unity of the whole. The circularity of
        “Cementerio en la ciudad,”
       where the fourth stanza picks up and places in time the scene of the first one, where every startling association is eluded to (except, slightly, in the adjectivization of the “clandestine dead”), points in that direction.</p></div><p>This sense of expression was accompanied in the Lake poets by a very determined prosody: a discarding of the heroic couplet and a recovery of the Miltonic blank verse, which in the last century had seen notable attempts, such as Young’s <em>Night Thoughts</em>. In Cernuda’s case, the search for a different musicality and a diffuse intensity, scattered throughout the whole poem, which does not privilege that moment of brilliance, is obtained in part from a similar attempt that resorts to a dialogue between grammatical unity and meter (that is, between the phrase and the sentence that strictly coincided with Pope, creating an effect of mere juxtaposition). The “sliding from one verse to another, which in Spanish I believe is called <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">encabalgamiento</span>” (<em>Prosa I</em> 650), in the words of Cernuda himself, will be one of the most constant features of his poetry of exile, as can be seen here in lines 6–7, 12–13, and 19–20. Again, the discursiveness reveals a poetics of unity: the true sign is the poem as a whole, and not a memorable fragment that can be removed from the piece without losing its meaning.</p><p>This discursiveness often stems from a morose <span class="foreign" xml:lang="la" lang="la">compositio loci</span>, which relates many similar poems to the model that M. H. Abrams (1965) considered characteristic of high Romanticism: the great ode, which after a descriptive start in which the speaker is situated, focuses one’s attention on a detail of the panorama to introduce a reflection and finally returns to the initial stage, as happens in some poems by Shelley, Wordsworth and, above all, Coleridge. In
        “Historial de un libro,”
       Cernuda linked this procedure with his teaching experience, in which he sought “that my explanations would lead the students to see for themselves what I was going to tell them” (<em>Prosa I</em> 645): in short, it was a question of evading the declarative form and seeking greater objectivity, not to blurt out to the reader a series of sentimental outpourings. It does not take much effort to recognize this series of events in
        “Cementerio en la ciudad,”
       where the delay in the descriptive phase is accompanied by figures of amplification and argumentation: the parenthesis (line 14), the enumeration (first and third stanzas), the rhetorical question (line 17), conciliation (lines 19–22), the apostrophe (lines 28–30). These are strategies to expand from particular anecdotes to universal themes as, in this case, death (and its paradoxical link with life, in a relationship that is not one of mutual exclusion). This meditative aspect of Cernudian writing—which José Ángel Valente highlighted in <em>Palabras de la tribu</em> (11–12), relating it to the idea of Coleridge’s imagination—would have been a great renewal for a Spanish poetry that Miguel de Unamuno contemptuously defined in his 1904 letter to Juan Arzadun as mere “rhymed eloquence,” since it would allow for the “sensory apprehension” of thought (60–61)—that is, a reconciliation of faculties that was an eminently Romantic aspiration and that Schiller had placed at the core of the aesthetic experience: once again, the search for unity.</p><p>Finally, it is not too risky to say that, due to a surrealist influence—Vicente Huidobro’s creationism, Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s humor, Ortega’s boldness and approval—the poem was often a succession of metaphors in Cernuda’s generation. His choice of maturity, however, consisted of opting for the image, as can be seen here in the verses 12–13, 22–23 and 26–27. So, what’s the big difference? The key difference is that against the purely tropical technique, against the substitutive game, the image allowed the coexistence of real and figurative elements, and a poet who pursued both the free flight of the imagination and the rescue of the most literal empirical reality thus found the bridge between both kingdoms. Jorge Luis Borges, always such a friend of British literature, agreed in this regard when he advised the Spanish writer to beware of the <span class="foreign" xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">phrase à effet</span> for ingenuity, which is a danger, in a controversy as old as Aristotle’s <em>Rhetoric</em>. “In the image,” declares Cernuda, “there is more poetic creation than in metaphor” (<em>Prosa I</em> 175). Why? For the very Romantic reason that “imagination is more holistic than wit." Unity, once again. It was not in vain that the task of the poet, as
        “Río vespertino”
       outlines, was to “see the scattered being in unity.” Cernuda applied himself to the task with tools that his vernacular tradition could not provide.</p></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5"><h2><span class="head">Works Cited</span></h2><div class="biblfree">Abrams, M.

Both writers depicted and identified Keats as a misunderstood figure that needed to be rescued by their intervention. They seek to integrate Keats as a member of their own intellectual community, regarding him “not as a master but as a comrade-in-arms.” Cortázar and Borges’s reading of Keats as a contemporary challenges the colonial view of Latin American literary creations as subsidiary of the European tradition, renegotiating transatlantic dynamics of colonial cultural interactions. The essay traces the theme of Negative Capability in Borges’s 1952 essay

Their poetic works had not only a literary but also a political impact in Spanish speaking countries, where they were seen as paradigmatic images of rebellion, independence, and revolution. These figures were incorporated and imported into the Latin American imagination as early as 1850 (as shown in this volume’s essays by Hart, Payán, and Insausti). Keats, however, did not enjoy the same celebrity; his short life was full of financial trouble, and it was very unlikely that he would inspire the imagination of the Latin American writers of the time, so avid of glamorous, Romantic heroism. His afterlives in this continent would not spark until the 1950s, when he was awoken by two Argentinian writers, Jorge Luis Borges and Julio Cortázar, who portray him as an odd presence of the English Romantic letters. They see in his image a reflection of their own condition as outsiders to the European canon. Although Keats is already established as a pillar of British poetry, they approach him as a sort of “minor” writer who has not yet received proper recognition. By strategically approaching Keats as an “underrated” predecessor, Borges and Cortázar succeed at transplanting him as a living presence into their own time and city of Buenos Aires, decades after the poet’s death in Rome. In Borges’s essay we will meet Keats by the fire of the family’s personal library. We will meet him again, later, walking arm in arm with Cortázar, wandering around the outskirts of the city.</p><p>My analysis of these transatlantic dialogues trace two different readings. In Borges’s works, the Romantic poet is the object of celebratory odes and the topic of an insightful essay that underscores his uniqueness and originality. With his characteristic erudite irony, Borges proposes that Keats has been misunderstood by English critics, and offers himself as a poetic defense attorney that pleads for a corrective view of his works. Cortázar, on the other hand, rescues Keats’s image through a lengthy biography written between 1948 and 1952, where he brings the Romantic poet as a pal that walks with him through Buenos Aires. Through an examination of these afterlives, I ask the question of how Cortázar and Borges invent their own image of the British poet in order to engage with him as equals. Subverting canonical and colonial hierarchies, both Argentinians draw portraits of Keats as a “marginal” and misunderstood poet that needs to be rescued by their intervention. They feel entitled to reinterpret and reassess the value of his works, to integrate his presence into their own community of intellectual peers—not as a master, but as a comrade-in-arms.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>It is no coincidence that two of the most prominent readers of Keats in Latin America happened to be from Argentina. Historically, this country was shaped and transformed by waves of immigration from the early nineteenth century through the first half of the twentieth. During these decades, the immigration of Europeans was not only well regarded, but encouraged and even facilitated by government policies.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note1" id="Note1_return"><sup class="super">

In some occasions the government also helped with the cost of relocation that incentivized the influx of migrants. For more information on this subject, see Fernando Devoto’s
        “Ideas, políticas y prácticas migratorias argentinas en una perspectiva de largo plazo (1852–1950).”
      </span></div></div> Like many other South American countries, after declaring its independence, the recently constituted Nation of Argentina sought to find its path towards progress and modernization. The feeling of belatedness in comparison to Europe caused the former colonies to look towards the Old Continent in search of political, intellectual and economic models. Politicians such as Domingo Faustino Sarmiento were convinced that by importing goods, products, and ideas, the country would promptly make its way into “civilization.”<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

I will not comment here on the problematic ideology behind these political decisions, nor about its socio-economic consequences. I allude to this historical event only to underline the fact that during these years, there was an important presence of European cultural goods, art objects, and ideas that were brought into the country by the families and individuals who established themselves here. The immigrants who came to Argentina and settled in the country brought with them not only a work force, industrial knowledge, machinery, and economic practices, but also their own languages, objects, and even their private book collections.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>This was the case of Jorge Luis Borges’s ancestors. Following the accounts that the author provides about the history of his family in his <em>Autobiographic Essay</em>, Emir Rodriguez Monegal reminds us of Borges’s English origins and alludes to the formative influence of the British grandmother who, “though she had come to Argentina as a young woman and had married an Argentine … continued to inhabit the English speaking world” (15). In his well-documented biography, Rodriguez Monegal tells the story of Fanny Haslam’s arrival to Argentina, her marriage to Francisco Borges, and the years she lived in the same household with both of Jorge Luis’ parents (7–9). Under Fanny’s care, Georgie—as he was called by his relatives—grew up speaking English at home and “learned to read in this language before he did in Spanish” (15). The importance of providing an English education in the Borges family is not to be underestimated: not only was the language used within the household but was also a fundamental part of their schooling. Instead of sending young Jorge Luis to a public institution, his father hired an English governess to oversee the first years of his son’s education (Rodriguez Monegal 98). This decision was not motivated exclusively by a nostalgic—and undoubtedly colonial—attachment to the traditions and culture of Europe. As the Uruguayan biographer observes, it must also be understood within the frame of historical events: <span class="quote">‘…there was then rampant in Argentina a sort of pro-British snobbery that would dominate Buenos Aires society as the century advanced … This change had an economic base … the independence of the River Plate area was achieved under the aegis of British diplomacy and commerce. Until World War II, Argentina belonged to the pound sterling international trading zone and was virtually part of the Commonwealth. (18) ’</span> The role England played in the development of industry, trade, politics, and culture was such that during the last quarter of the century, as Erika Beckman reminds us, Argentina formed part of what historians have called “Britain’s ‘informal’ empire” (112).<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">

This is the case of Borges’s family collection, full of “unlimited English books,” which Jorge Luis speaks of with marvel: “If I were asked to name the chief event in my life, I should say it was my father’s library. In fact, sometimes I think I have never strayed out of that library” (quoted by Rodriguez Monegal 3). It is in this room—remembered by Borges as a mythical space—that he one night felt the revelation of poetry as he heard his father recite the
        “Ode To a Nightingale.”
       This is also the moment when his apprectiation for Keats started, as did his life-long dialogue with the poet. In a house of British descendants located on the outskirts of Buenos Aires, amongst an admirable collection of English books, began the first of Keats’s Argentinian afterlives discussed here.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

        “Keats en Borges,”
       where she gives a thorough account and analysis of the symbolic presence of the nightingale in several short stories of the Argentine writer. See also Jason Wilson’s essay included in the commemorative book, Keats, Borges and the Nightingale.</span></div></div></p></div><p>In <em>Otras inquisitionces</em> (1952), Borges includes an essay entitled
        “El ruiseñor de Keats”
       (
        “Keats’s Nightingale”
      ). This text puts forwards an interpretation of the famous ode where Borges underscores an opposition between human transcience and poetic immortality. Borges analyzes this poem as a reflection upon the atemporality of the poetic rapture that is presented as successive across the ages and is, therefore, eternal. The nightingale is adopted as the symbolic image of this phenomenon and when it is perceived, the poetic mystery is momentarily revealed. However, this revelation also brings about awareness of one’s own mortality: when confronted with the sublime feeling of beauty and eternity, humans are reminded of their own death. Though Borges’s interpretation is interesting, there is not much novelty in it. What I want to highlight instead as an original approach in his text is the fact that Borges insists on drawing a portrait of Keats as a “marginal” and misundersood figure. In order to do so, he skillfully combines biographical information with critical readings of the ode to put forward a rather heterodox interpretation.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>In the opening lines of the essay, Borges alludes, almost as in passing, to the hardships that defined Keats’s life: <span class="quote">‘Sick with tuberculosis, poor and perhaps also unfortunate in love, at the age of twenty-three, on one April night of 1819, he composed the
        “Ode to a Nightingale.”
       In that suburban garden, he heard the eternal nightingale of Ovid and Shakespeare, and he felt his own mortality, and he contrasted it to the tenuous everlasting voice of the invisible bird.” (II: 95)<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>All translations of texts from Spanish or French in this article are mine, with the exception of the fragments of Imagen de John Keats, which are a collaborative translation by Olivia Loksing Moy and myself. The original Spanish titles will be used for in-text quotations and references.</span></div></div>’</span> His appropriation of the Romantic poet emphasizes the elements that make of him an underdog, a “suburbian” presence with regards to his environment and to the English tradition. The insistence on drawing his portrait according to the legend of “poor Keats,” as well as his emphatic location of the poet in a “jardin suburbano,” responds to the centrifugal force by which Borges tries to pull the Romantic poet towards a position of symbolic marginality. And by doing so, he succeeds in locating himself in a position of parity with his English peer. The essay elaborates on this “creative misreading”—using Harold Bloom’s critical term—and uses additional critical materials to reinforce a fringe-reading of Keats. It is not by chance nor a mere adherence to conventions that Borges forefronts this information. The dramatic effect of this presentation moves the reader to interpret his sickness and poverty as signs announcing Keats’s isolation and estrangement. By highlighting this, Borges applies the first brush strokes of a portrait that fits the legend of “poor Keats” which, as Edward Hirsch observes, “comes not only from his early detractors … but also from some of his later admirers” (xvii). What we find in the letters, as well as in the many reliable biographies of the poet (Lowell, Roe, Bate), is that the spring of 1819 was not such a terrible season for Keats. Although the first signs of his illness were already manifest, his health had not yet dramatically deteriorated. Following the death of his brother, he is constantly sourrounded by close friends and keeps a most active social life. Additionally, he has just met Fanny Brawne and they have fallen in love. None of this comes across in the depiction that Borges offers, where we find a much more passive, frail, and isolated character. The Argentine author selects a number of facts that fit into the legend of the feeble and sensitive artist outcasted by his society. By creating a narrative that coherently reinforces this view, the displacement of the English writer to a position of marginality allows Borges to situate himself in a relation of closeness and empathy from which he can advocate for his predecesor.</p></div><p>Simultaneously, as he builds up the case of margnizalization that calls for a corrective intervention, Borges advances a veiled tactic of identification: by pointing out that the place of composition of the ode was a suburban garden, he draws a parallel with his own biography. He wishes to stress the fact that he and Keats are located on the peripheries of their respective cities. Both Keats and Borges are poets of the outskirts. What appears as a seemingly anecdotal remark points to a more complex strategy of shifting towards the margins of cultural centers. Symbolically, Borges is trying to dislodge this celebrated bard from his pedestal and drags him back out to the outposts of the English tradition. While recognizing his centrality for the canon of British poetry, Borges is more interested in emphasizing the image of an isolated Keats who does not fully belong to London society. By placing him back in the suburbs, the Argentine writer starts laying the suggestion that will be developed in further paragraphs: to encounter Keats, to dialogue freely with him, they must meet outside of the charted maps of metropolis. As they move away from the established cultural centers, hierarchies weaken and the stability of literary institutions starts to fade out, allowing for alternative networks of connection to be created and relations of influence to be renegotiated. </p><p>Before moving forward with this portrayal of Keats, a note on the notion of Borges’s sense of marginality is needed. The notion of a not-subordinate “periphery” becomes fundamental to understand Borges’s dialogues with other Western cultures and literary figures. In 1992, Beatriz Sarlo presented a series of lectures on the works of the Argentinian writer where she proposed to understand him as a “writer on the edge.” The central concept of her study was that of the “border,” and she analyzed Borges’s literature as one that is issued from gaps, spaces in between frontiers, and blurried limits. Sarlo points out that Borges’s poetry and fictions explore the imaginary spaces dividing the city and the countryside, the idealized epic past and his own present time, mythology and history, fiction and reality. Similarly, she observes how his writings are built upon a dialogue between national and cosmopolitan elements that intertwine and create a territory of exchange, tension, and hybridization. The Argentine author oscillates between local elements with which he does not totally identify, and the “nostalgia for a European culture which can never wholly offer an alternative cultural base” (Sarlo). By locating himself in the margins of his own culture and in the sidelines of other traditions, he makes his literature shift from one border to others, constantly renewing lines of attachment and familiarity to each side: <span class="quote">‘By reinventing a national tradition, Borges also offers Argentine culture an oblique reading of Western literatures. From the edge of the West, Borges achieves a literature that is related to foreign literature but not in any subordinate way… (Sarlo) ’</span> In accordance with Sarlo’s view of Borges as a writer on the margins, I would like to expand her idea and consider the Argentinian intellectual also as a “reader of edges.” From his self-assumed position as an outsider, he reshuffles the networks of literary tradition, bringing to light unexplored faces of canonic writers and uncharted paths of connection between texts that would otherwise remain foreign to each other. The reading of other authors as if they were also in the edges of their own time and space allows for the creation of alternative options of spatial and chronological organization that do not need to conform to the constrains of geographical proximity or linear historicity. What Borges as a reader of peripheries gains is the possibility to playfuly appropriate elements from the central tradition in order to bring them outside of their original circles in order to playfully rearrange them, reinvent new constellations and move around grativational centers.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>But let us return now to Borges’s portrayal of Keats and the interpretation of his poetry. After this presentation of the background and biographical information of the English poet, Borges claims that Keats’s
        “Ode To a Nightingale”
       has been essentially misunderstood by Anglophone intellectuals and critics. First he points at what, in his opinion, is the most remarkable aspect of the poem: Keats’s intuitive vision of the bird as a platonic archetype. He contrasts his platonic reading of the poem with that of other scholars he deems erroneous. In his essay, Borges quotes Sidney Colvin’s opinion as a first example misinterpretation: <span class="quote">‘In his monographic work about Keats, published in 1887, Sideney Colvin … <em>perceived or invented</em> a difficulty in the aforementioned [seventh] stanza. I transcribe his curious declaration: “by a breach of logic which is also, I think, a flaw in the poetry, he contrasts the transitoriness of human life, meaning the life of the individual, with the permanence of the song-bird’s life, meaning the life of the type” (II: 95, emphasis added)’</span> With his characteristic irony, Borges labels Colvin’s observation as “voluntary” misperception. As he questions the validity of the division between the individual and the type set by the critic, he also undermines the opinion of other scholars who adhere to this premise: Robert Briges, F.R. Leavis, and H.W. Garrod (95). He is less severe with the opinion of Amy Lowell, for whom the nightingale of the poem should be interpreted only as the “species nightingale,”<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">
            (6)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>The passage by Amy Lowell that Borges refers to is the following: “Stanza seven has been the cause of much foolish chatter. In calling the nightingale ‘immortal bird’ and contrasting its eternity of life with individual man’s short existence, any one with a spark of imaginative or poetical feeling realizes at once that Keats is not referring to the particular Nightingale singing at that instant, but to the species nightingale” (252).</span></div></div> and not as an individual presence. Borges goes on to drastically deny that there is any opposition whatsoever between the actual bird heard by Keats “on one April night of 1819” and the generic image.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">
            (7)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>It is interesting to note that Borges incorrectly dates the composition of the poem: he dates it in April while Lowell clearly states, “we know the Nightingale to have been written in May” (237).</span></div></div> To support his opinion, he turns to Schopenhauer’s theory of archetypes and quotes from <em>The World as Will and Representation</em>: <span class="quote">‘Ask yourself honestly whether the swallow of this year’s spring is an entirely different one from the swallow of the first spring, and whether actually between the two the miracle of creation out of nothing has been renewed a million times, in order to work just as often into the hands of absolute annihilation. (II: 482) ’</span> This excerpt provides an endorsement to interpret the nightingale as an embodiment of a platonic form. From the perspective of the German philosopher, the bird heard by Keats repeats the same song as all other nightingales that ever existed. This reading was, to Borges, just too evident, and he is puzzled by fact that no English reader had been able to solve the question sooner: “How did Garrad, Leavis, and the like, not get to this interpretation?” (II: 95). In a provocative statement, he ascribes this blindness to what, in his opinion, is an essential trait of the British character: <span class="quote">‘Men, says Coleridge, are born Aristotelian or Platonic. One could say that the English mind was born Aristotelian. What is real, for this type of mentality, are not the abstract concepts, but the individualities; not the generic nightingale, but the concrete nightingales. It is only natural, inevitable perhaps, that the <em>Ode to a nightingale</em> was not rightfully understood in England. (II: 96)’</span> Borges adopts Coleridge’s philosophical binary categorization as a tool to emphasize his representation of Keats as a <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">mal compris</span>. Through this reductive division, he is able to disconnect the Romantic writer from the “British” mental sphere, and he offers a depiction of an unfortunate Platonist isolated among Aristotelians. The Argentine even offers an <span xml:lang="la" lang="la" class="foreign">excusatio</span> that reinforces his ultimate goal of detaching Keats from the intellectual habitat of his country: “No one should read in the previously stated ideas a sign of disaproval or disdain … [The Englishman] does not understand the <em>Ode to a Nightingale,</em> but that valuable misunderstanding allows him to become a Locke, a Berkeley, a Hume” (97). This elegant attack, disguised as an <em>encomium</em>, is intended to build up the accusation that will open a necessary space for his own intervention. Reading and speaking from the outside of British tradition, Borges feels entitled to offer a corrective judgement of one of the main English poets and with utmost irreverence he defies the hierarchical organisation that relegates him to a place of subordination. He turns the tables around and locates himself in a position of intellectual superiority that symbolically refutes any colonial dependency or belatedness with regards to Europe. South-American intellectuals, he seems to assert, are sufficiently prepared to beat Europeans at their own games.</p></div><p>In the essay previously analysed, Borges relies on the legend of “poor Keats” to depict a frail and contemplative young boy touched by poetic illumination. Other biographers and intellectuals, however, recognize that there is another side to his life that must be accounted for: that of the lively, energetic, and curiosity-driven young man. Nicholas Roe, for instance, highlights the fact that if, on the one hand, we have a “‘a sickly boy of pretty abilities’ who had missed his path in the world,” it is also necessary to see in him the “sturdy twenty-two-year-old, who strode six hundred miles around Scotland” (xv). Julio Cortázar is very keen to perceive this other facet of Keats, and it is in this light that he will compose his literary biography. For Cortázar, the Romantic writer appears as a presence full of joy, creativity, and poetic intelligence. His depiction is much closer to the impression that Roe gives, where the poet is described as “vigorous, colorful and animated” (xv), “a smart, streetwise creature—restless, pugnacious” (xvi). As we will now see, in his second Argentine afterlife, Keats does not inhabit the library of a suburban house; he appears as an energetic walker and an adventurous explorer. </p><p>If Borges identified the nightingale as Keats’s totemic animal, Cortázar opted for the chameleon. The main characteristic that Cortázar highlights is his sympathetic capacity, the ability to become one with the other, and the ability to establish links of identification outside of the realms of one’s own subjectivity. In an attempt to present the Romantic poet as a living presence beyond his short life and the borders of British circles, the literary biography <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> opens up as a complex artifact in which Cortázar is able to relive part of Keats’s existence, and Keats can experience the contemporary Buenos Aires of his interlocutor (Ana Martínez 196). Thanks to a chamaleonic strategy of identification, Cortázar perceives his immediate reality through the eyes of the English poet to which he also lends his words. This sensibility of empathy and synchronicity resonates clearly with the “capacity of trascending the self, which Keats calls negative capability” (Linda Von Pfahl 453). The biographer becomes, then, a sort of “chameleon Poet” who—borrowing a passage from the famous letter to Woodhouse—“is perhaps not speaking from [himself]; but from some character in whose soul [he] now live[s]” (Keats 501). Cortázar engages in a process of identification with this “other” and, by doing so, develops the capacity of adopting “metamorphic identities, which furnish him with constant symapthetic identifications” (Li Ou 6). This aspect of the Keatsian negative capability is clearly recognizable throughout the biography, but I wish to highlight several passages when this phenomenon stands out more vividly.</p><p>First, Cortázar draws a parallel between Keats’s journey to Scotland and his own excursion to Chile: <span class="quote">‘I do not know why the trip to the north that John Keats is about to undertake in 1818 brings me back to my own hiking trip in Chile. It is maybe because the two expeditions were mainly by foot and through landscapes surrounded by mountains and lakes… Upon my return from that trip I understood better Keats’s tour around Scotland and the region of the lakes. Without any touristic sentimentalization of it, I understood his state of mind: alert and vigilant before a reality that only partially captures his attention. (178–79) ’</span> By recreating a journey that is comparable to Keats’s hiking tour through Scotland, Cortázar retrospectively remembers his own his trek in the Chilean mountains as a process of “becoming” John. A phenomenon of reflection allows Cortázar to see his life through the lens of Keats’s biography. What this excerpt shows is that the Argentinian, following the practice of emptying out the self, uses this strategy of sympathetic identification as an epistemological tool.</p><p>A second example of chameleonism resonates even more clearly with the Keatsian practice of openness and receptivity. As Cortázar recounts his first trip to Italy and recounts the feeling of awe that he experiences before the marvel of Greek sculptures, he borrows the words and the empathetic capacities of Keats himself to narrate this overwhelming experience: <span class="quote">‘I remember that a year ago I went to the museum in Naples, one morning of powdery light rain. That was my first reencounter with Greece. Annihilated, haunted, I was not thinking, I was not understanding, I was not comparing. Later I had something like a revelation, in which during those hours, I had been <em>nobody</em>, replaced by—how should I say this?—the statues that looked at themselves, that recognized themselves. It was as if they were chasing me away, throwing me out, but not “outside of my own being,” because the one being ousted was precisely my “self,” to the point where there was nothing outside of the marble recognizing one another, looking at each other, and enjoying themselves. (265–66)’</span> This description of the museum shows a striking similarity with Keats’s own ideas and words, to the point where it could almost be read as a personal rewriting of the famous October 1818 letter: <span class="quote">‘As to the poetical Character itself… it is not itself—it has no self—It is everything and nothing—It has no character— … the poet has none; no identity … When I am in a room with People, if I ever am free from speculating on creations of my own brain, then, not myself goes home to myself, but the identity of every one in the room begins to press upon me, so that I am in a very little time annihilated. (Keats 500–501) ’</span> Not only does Cortázar copy words, concepts, and even phrasings from this passage, but he also adopts the same philosophy of poetic anihilation. In a two-folded mimetic exercise, the Argentine embodies simultaneously Keats—on a textual level—and the statues he is contemplating—on his circumstantial plane.</p><p>Keats’s “negative capability” also has an influence in Cortázar’s world view that goes beyond the biographic identification pointed out earlier. For the Argentinian writer, this empathetic ability also gains aesthetic, political, and ethical resonances. Ana del Castillo and Ana Martínez Santa recognize the fundamental importance that “negative capability” had in the development of Cortázar’s poetics and trace the presence of the “sympathetic imagination” in his novels and shorts stories. Both scholars follow trails of the symbolic presence of the chameleon all the way to the 1967 book <em>La vuelta al día en ochenta mundos</em>, in which Cortázar includes a short piece entitled
        “Casilla del camaleón”
       (
        “Chameleon’s square”
      ). Here, Keats’s poetic theory is subjected to an unexpected political reading. In a heterodox interpretation of the chameleon theory, the author understands Keats’s sympathetic identification as a humanist force with a political implication: the unfailing recognition of other as equal. He frames this interpretation in what he calls a “Latin American time” and defends the importance of a poet like Keats in times when artists and intellectuals are judged based on their historical engagement (<em>La vuelta</em> 189). Cortázar does not hide his leftist affiliations and makes a strong defense of them, but also stands up for the validity and necessity of literary figures who do not restrict their works to ideological objectives. His vindication of Keats is thus very significant within the Latin American context. In the first place, it rehabilitates an aesthetic and sensitive approach to literature in a period when this option was considered out of fashion and socially irresponsible. Secondly, it provides the English poet with a letter of recommendation that grants him an entrance to Latin American circles where he would not have been admited otherwise.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Julio Cortázar also perceived Keats as a “peripheral” figure and highlighted this condition with the purpose of relating to him as an equal. Through an act of creative misreading, the Argentine biographer dislodges Keats outside of the boundaries of his own time and relates to him as a contemporary. In <em>Imagen</em>, Cortázar creates the illusion that they both coexist in the margins of chronological time and meet in a dimension where temporal and geographic distances have been collapsed<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Olivia Loksing Moy’s article
        “From Hampstead to Buenos Aires and Beyond: Anticipating Worlds in Julio Cortázar’s Imagen de John Keats”
       offers an excellent analysis of the collapsing of temporal references in Cortázar’s texts. Moy cleverly explores the sense of “transtemporality” in Imagen de John Keats through the perspective of Way Chee Dimock’s concept of “deep time,” and offers an interesting take on Cortázar’s position in the map of World Literature.</span></div></div>. As temporal linearity is challenged in the pages of this biography, the sense of belatedness is also contested by Cortázar. From the opening pages of the introduction, it is made evident that the Argentinian does not look up to the British poet from a subsidiary position but speaks to him as an equal and challenges any assumptions of hierarchical subordination. The structure of their interaction does not reproduce a colonial pattern of defferent imitation and submission but, rather, maps a horizontal line of exchange. In the chapter labeled
        “Methodology,”
       Cortázar states: <span class="quote">‘[I am going to write with] Keats on my arm; a more natural way to get to know him, rather than the usual manner, where the poor guy is put up on a cloud as the literary critics throw together a couple of chairs and tables to build a stage that he didn’t even need in the first place… And all this forms a part of this Keats, because I’m not going to write about him, I’m going to walk by his side. (19) ’</span> Rejecting the academic perspective in favor of a more familiar approach, Cortázar questions chronological lines, geographic divisions, and epistemological categories. Not only does he pretend to inhabit the same time and place as his peer, he also offers an alternative—and very Keatsian—way of access to literary knowledge: an empathetic identification. This is accurately observed by Steven Boldy: <span class="quote">‘<em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is a competent academic study… but it is also the day-to-day chronicle of an intimate friendship, and of the connections he builds with a poet “friend,” a model he admires. It is, at the same time, the chronicle of this relation and that of the writing of the book: Cortázar walks arm in arm with Keats in the streets of Buenos Aires and Hampstead. The phenomenon of identification is powerful… (18)’</span> In the reconstruction of Keats’s literary biography Cortázar appears as an unapologetic and daring misreader. His goal is not that of rendering a faithful and elegiac homage to an English master. On the contrary, he strives to recognize Keats as a quotidian and tangible presence: <span class="quote">‘… in the past weeks John’s physical presence has haunted me more and more as I read his letters… All of a sudden he is so close by my side that it frightens me ... I see him, he is here; time yields to this tangential contact that drops me in 1819, in this suburb of time… in the heaths of Hampstead. (<em>Imagen</em> 214)’</span> The text evidences a chronological multidirectionality that drops Cortázar into the Hampstead of 1819 and brings Keats to the Buenos Aires of 1950. This is, for Boldy, one of the most interesting aspects of the book: “the way by which the Romantic English poet becomes a contemporary of … Julio Cortázar. The latter, as a scholar, shows a profound knowledge of Keats and his epoch, as well as of his fellow Romantic writers … but he also affirms that it is necessary to read Keats as a contemporary voice” (19). Bondy recognizes the originality of the particular temporal displacement performed by Cortázar: he does not only transplant himself to the past as a meticulous historian, but also allows this poet from the nineteenth century to live, act, and speak in the present time, where he recognizes him as an active formative presence: <blockquote class="quote">… I cannot <em>feel</em> Keats in the past. I don’t run into Keats on the street, nor do I expect to hear his voice over the phone <p class="noCount">(and how beautiful it would have been to hear his voice, seeing him coming, short as he was, a little commoner, treating himself to a laugh)</p> <p class="noCount">but sometimes, I’m wandering around and I do run into poets of my own time and John is one of them. (<em>Imagen</em> 52–53)</p></blockquote> Cortázar recognizes the limitations of the knowledge he can achieve through intellectual explorations. As a historian and a biographer, he can only draw a partial understanding of the person that was Keats, of his intuitions of beauty, his capacity for irradiating poetry. For he is unable to “feel” Keats in this dimension, he seeks to recognize in his environment the elements and people that evoke his presence. Reversing the direction of Keats’s sympathetic capacity, Cortázar searches for those of whom, in this time, awaken the memory and the presence of Keats.</p></div><p>The dialectic movement in time that structures <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> attests to a search for an alternative idea of contemporaneousness. Instead of relying on temporal coincidence, the Argentinian proposes an idea that is very close to T.S. Eliot’s notion of tradition as a simultaneous order of existence: <span class="quote">‘Tradition is a matter of much wider significance. It cannot be inherited, and if you want it you must obtain it by great labor. It involves, in the first place, the historical sense … and the historical sense involves a perception, not only of the pastness of the past, but of its presence; the historical sense compels a man to write not merely with his own generation in his bones, but with a feeling that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order. (38) ’</span> For Eliot, past and present coexist in this imaginary dimension, and Virgil is virtually as close to Baudelaire as he is to Ezra Pound—his <em>Four Quartets</em> and <em>The Waste Land</em> are a faithful testimony and an illustration of this principle. The same functional reorganization of history can be recognized in <em>Imagen</em>, where the categories of temporal and geographic distance have been suspended. If the nineteenth-century poet can be seen as a contemporary it is because, to the eyes of Cortázar, both inhabit a dimension where the notion of proximity is determined by aesthetic, philosophical, and artistic affinities. This flexible notion of time and tradition allows him to knit an elaborate network of synchronicity that brings together otherwise distant authors. <em>Imagen</em> includes a constellation of other poets that the Argentine biographer also declares as citizens of Keats’s time: Rimbaud, Rilke, Valéry, Saint-John Perse, Neruda, and García Lorca, among others. In the chapter
        “Being in the World,”
       Cortázar identifies, for instance, two of the most remarkable Spanish readers of Keats: Vicente Aleixandre (1898–1984) and Luis Cernuda (1902–1963). Despite the historical, cultural, and temporal gaps that divide them, Cortázar recognizes in them a fundamental “coincidence of attitudes and lyric production” that allow him to conceive them as “kindred Spanish-speaking poets; close to him, similar to him,” to his dear Keats (253).</p><p>The two Keatsian afterlives that I have presented in the previous pages continue to be the most remarkable and significant readings of this Romantic poet in Latin America. As I have shown, Cortázar and Borges, writing from outside of the English tradition, claim the right to reappropriate Keats’s works and to integrate him as part of their most intimate and immediate cultural landscape. Both of them compose personal portraits and adapt the image of the nightingale and the chameleon to their own cultural landscape. By doing so, they readjust the divisions between center and periphery, challenging national, cultural, linguistic and academic boundaries. Their gestures of “irreverence” towards the canon and the centrality of the English tradition are far more significant than a playful demystification. What Cortázar and Borges achieve by bringing the dialogue to a familiar level is opening alternative symbolic spaces of interaction between Latin America and Europe. </p><p>The sense of arriving belatedly to the “banquet of civilization”—as Alfonso Reyes states it (5)—was particularly acute in Latin America throughout the nineteenth century. In the early twentieth century, the movement of “modernismo” was the first to claim the right to a cosmopolitan culture and to dialogue with traditions beyond the peninsular Spanish heritage. From this moment on, the debate about the place of Latin America on the map of Western and world culture was remarkably animated. Cortázar and Borges are two examples of cosmopolitan intellectuals who defend the right of Latin American writers, artists and intellectuals to be recognized as part of that “universal” tradition to which, writing from a peripheral space, they did not have full access. Echoing Borges, Cortázar makes a strong defense of the idea that Latin America has as much right to profit from European traditions as any other intellectual from England, France, the United States, or any other country. Their literary dialogues with Keats are an example of the attitude towards culture that Borges described in his famous essay,
        “The Argentine Writer and The Tradition”
      : <span class="quote">‘I believe our tradition is all of Western culture, and I also believe we have a right to this tradition, greater than that which the inhabitants of one or another Western nation might have ... I believe that we Argentines, we South Americans in general, are in an analogous situation; we can handle all European themes, handle them without superstition, with an irreverence which can have, and already does have, fortunate consequences. (I: 274) ’</span> The self-assumed peripheral condition of Borges and Cortázar, as I have argued, becomes a condition of productivity. The strategy of writing and reading from the margins, allows them to engage differently with the canon of European literary tradition. Instead of perpetuating a logic of submission and imitation, they actively engage in a renegotiation of their place in the broader western and universal tradition.</p><div class="citation" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1"><h2><span class="head">Works Cited</span></h2><div class="biblfree">Bate, Walter Jackson. <em>John Keats</em>.

An amphibious text that oscillates between a rigorous work of criticism and a playful work of fiction, it follows two lines of national influence: the Latin American surrealist short story and Romantic poetry. Moreover, in staging a sense of timeless contemporaneity by strategically merging literary-historical events, the book brings together Keats, Shelley, and Hunt with Cortázar’s own circle of Argentine friends and intellectuals. This rippling of chronologies makes it possible for Cortázar to personally inhabit a Romantic universality, rendering Keats accessible to the Latin American “everyman.”</p></section></div><!--TEI body--><div class="tei_body"><section class="essay" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1"><header><h1><span class="head">To Carry Keats in Your Pocket: Julio Cortázar’s Everyman Poet</span></h1></header><div class="byline"><span class="docAuthor">Olivia Loksing Moy</span> <br xmlns:html="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" />City University of New York, Lehman College</div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.1"><p>In the 1950s, the Argentinian author Julio Cortázar (1914–1984) composed an ambitious work—a “life and letters” of his favorite Romantic poet. The result was <em>Imagen de John Keats</em>, a six-hundred-page collage of Keats’s poems and letters, Cortázar’s own prose, and a myriad of references to Latin American, Spanish, German, French, and British authors. This little-known masterpiece covers the entirety of Keats’s adult life and works, beginning with <em>Sleep and Poetry</em> and ending with his lesser-known dramas and posthumous works. Inspired by Cortázar’s Spanish translation of Richard Monckton Milnes’s <em>The Life and Letters of John Keats</em>, published in Madrid in 1955, it far exceeds Lord Houghton’s efforts in its geographical and generic scope.</p><p><em>Imagen de John Keats</em> opens with a gust of brightness and momentum, its initial sentence announcing participation in the Romantic tradition by calling upon Nature, Imagination, and an Aeolian breeze: “This is a Romantic book, driven by its impulse towards its theme with the focus and faithfulness of a sunflower” (15). Playful and ambulatory, Cortázar’s text meanders in and out of the modes of biography, literary criticism, personal essay, and artistic memoir. It functions as a Keats anthology tailored for the Latin American reader, as well as a collection of Cortázar’s annotated translations and original poems. The methodological declarations, personal effusions, and literary references culminate in what Victor Zonana terms a “generic hybrid” and the work of a “poet-critic” who, rather than composing an erudite and academic study, traces the process of a poetry “in the making” (57). But while it oscillates between various genres, <em>Imagen</em> is presented as one organic structure, its formidable
        “Table of Contents”

Especially given Cortázar’s recognition as a global author of the Latin American Boom movement, that <em>Imagen</em> has eluded critical attention cannot solely be attributed to the fact that the work has not yet been fully translated into English.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note2" id="Note2_return"><sup class="super">

This essay introduces Cortázar’s <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> to unfamiliar readers by elucidating its genre and methodology. Attending to important parallels between Cortázar’s and Keats’s literary circles, I then situate the work within Cortázar’s own statements on the transcultural transmission of English Romantic works to a Latin American audience.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p><em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is unique among Latin American afterlives of the English Romantic poets in two significant ways. First, it is a truly transtemporal work, jumping timelines and collapsing eras within one literary plane. Cortázar creates a dynamic field that accommodates a motley crew of ancient Greek, Renaissance, Romantic, and modern Hispanophone figures. This differs from typical neoromantic interactions of twentieth-century writers who might simply import and repurpose familiar motifs of Wordsworth or Shelley in a postmodern context. Instead, throughout <em>Imagen</em>, Cortázar inhabits the same time and locales as Keats. What we witness is a contemporaneous overlapping of two literary circles: Cortázar and his fellow writers of the Boom era are superimposed upon the world of Hunt, Shelley, Wordsworth, and Blake. These figures intermingle in pages redolent of Cortázar’s signature style, featuring the crossing of paths of a seemingly listless flaneur. While <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is one of Cortázar’s non-fiction works, its cast of characters occupies a fiction-like space projected onto an epic scale. In this essay, I draw upon the imagery of playing hopscotch and “blowing up” (expanding) an image—borrowed from two of Cortázar’s most famous works, <em>Hopscotch</em> (1963) and
        “Blow-up”
       (1967)—to explore the experimentation he employs throughout his innovative treatise on Keats.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note3" id="Note3_return"><sup class="super">
            (3)
          </sup></a><div class="tooltip"><span>Cortázar’s major novel Hopscotch (Rayuela) is often regarded as a text marking the beginning of the Latin American Boom, while his short story

      ) was immortalized in film by Michelangelo Antonioni in 1966.</span></div></div> In so doing, I seek to restore the lost reception of <em>Imagen</em> by untangling the two factors most problematic to the text’s transmission: periodization and genre.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>In the opening section of <em>Imagen</em>, titled
        “Preludes,”
       Cortázar announces the scope of his project in teasingly lofty and legal language, calling his opening a “Sworn Statement.” At other points, as in the chapter
        “Sleep and Poetry,”
       he shifts into a confiding voice, assuming the mode of personal essay or of casual biography. His reportage of Keats’s life in the section titled
        “Romanticism”
       feels at times flippant and comical: <blockquote class="quote"><div class="wrapper"><p>He is twenty-one years old in 1816.

For him, Hampstead (an Adrogué of London) contains all of Greek mythology. Under this sky, John begins to raise the shadow of the god that he has elected for his suffering and salvation: Shakespeare. And this is where we find him. So, John, let’s walk together, shall we?<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note4" id="Note4_return"><sup class="super">

He speaks authoritatively and on behalf of Keats, as if present throughout the poet’s early years. The reference to Adrogué, a small town in the suburbs of Buenos Aires with cobble-stoned streets and town squares, familiarizes the foreignness of Hampstead through analogy and geographic translation. Rather than glossing an Argentinian reference for the benefit of an English audience, Cortázar naturally reverses the Anglocentric orientation, catering to his ideal Latin American reader. Ultimately, it is Cortázar who invites Keats for an exploratory stroll, not the other way around. His physical metaphor for companionship, of walking side by side, serves as a leitmotif throughout the text, proposing a relation of friendship and equality rather than one of idolatry or infatuation. This becomes an enduring theme in the structure, spirit, and timescale that is central to Cortázar’s treatise on Keats.</p></div><p>Taking after Samuel Johnson’s <em>Lives of the Poets</em> in its biographical homage, and emulating the personal accounts from Hazlitt’s
        “My First Acquaintance with Poets,”
       <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> incorporates personal anecdotes with stylistic critique, whether offering its cultural commentary on nineteenth-century England or twentieth-century Buenos Aires. The work exhibits a comfortable mastery over figures in British literature, offhandedly alluding to lines of Spenser, Herbert, Wordsworth, and Coleridge as if they were close friends. Cortázar’s invocation of these authors is casual but not disrespectful; he gestures toward these canonical figures with disarming hospitality and a gracious informality. In an intriguing balance between admiration and sauciness, Cortázar conjures up a living community populated by Shelley, Byron, “John,” “Bob Burns,” George and Tom, and even “Mom and Dad”: </p><blockquote class="quote"><p class="noCount">… John was born in autumn—the 31st of October, 1795—the year and the season in which Wordsworth and Coleridge met, with illustrious consequences. It was the year of the guillotine in the front shores of France…[Then] another star: William Blake, a <em>nova</em> of nineteen years-old, another space of ignorance of ice cold, black air that separated his light and that of Keats. And to think that, in 1795, he had already written the <em>Songs of Innocence and Experience</em>. John was barely crawling when Bob Burns, drowning in alcohol and ballads, after confusing immortality with a snowy night, was dying up in the north. Shelley was three years old, Byron seven. What a nursery!</p> <p class="noCount">Mom and Dad were just common people. There’s an obscure side in the family life of Keats that gave him such a proclivity to psychoanalysis. He comes afloat after a confusing childhood, closely tied to his two brothers, George and Tom, (both of them younger than him), and also to Fanny, the flip-flop of the household, who very early in his life bestowed upon Keats’ a predestined name.</p> <p class="noCount">(<em>Imagen</em> 29)</p></blockquote><p> Here, Cortázar is at ease, mapping out the baby steps and first literary strides of William Blake and Robert Burns. He converts the publication timelines of Romantic literary geniuses into anecdote and caricature, pure baby stuff: “What a nursery!” He inserts himself into the scene of “John’s” infancy, bearing witness by inviting himself into the Keats family household and into the childhood playpens of the Big Six as well. Freely working on a first-name basis, he flits in and out as a welcome member of the clan with carefree familiarity. This quick movement from a grand historical scale to such individual intimacy characterizes much of the lengthy book and lends a dynamic rhythm to the long stretches of prose. Cortázar often zooms in at a rapid pace, “blowing up” meaningful moments to notice the possibility of unrealized, fantastic detail behind the mundane. This zooming in and out is an important device that breathes magic into the ending of Cortázar’s surrealist short story <em>Blow-Up,</em> in which the expanded print of a camera snapshot, scrutinized in the photographer’s studio after the moment of capture, reveals a chain of unforeseen possibilities and traumas. It allows the past to become present, locked in a dynamic stasis and primed for revelation and analysis. Such is the process of “blowing up” and developing the “image” of John Keats, opening up possibilities for alternative representations of the poet we thought we knew.</p><p>Blowing up images allows for a mode of discovery that curates moments and transcends chronological time. In his literary practice of merging times and epochs, Cortázar intimately enters the Romantic past and brings the coterie of the Keats-Shelley circle to life, communing with Byron, Coleridge, Shelley, Haydon, and Hunt; but he also shows how these spirits have come to life in his own day. He recognizes them in the works of contemporary Latin-American poets and translators, such as Ricardo Molinari, Francisco Luis Bernárdez and Miguel Cané (22). In many passages, Cortázar keeps the text humming with experimental punctuation and an irregular distribution of paragraphs that is particularly vivacious and poetic. </p><blockquote class="quote">I’m thinking of others who have felt Keats among us. I think of Miguel Cané, of whom I quote a beautiful passage in the prologue of the translation that we were working on that afternoon, <p class="noCount">on Julio A. Roca and Rafael Alberto Arrieta, who translated him,</p> <p class="noCount">on Daniel Devoto, always willing to present me with the most accurate bibliographic findings,</p> <p class="noCount">on Lorenzo Mascialino, who comes every now and then with a piece of news, a scrap from an Italian magazine, a scroll.</p> <p class="noCount">How many young boys are walking around with a little volume of <em>Everyman</em> in their pockets to read young Keats on the street, in the open air, under the green umbrellas of the squares. Keats is something to be carried in your pocket, where you carry the things that really matter. Your hands, your money, your handkerchief; the bookshelves shall be reserved for Coleridge and for T.S. Eliot, who are lamp-poets. A pocket is the house for the essential and the portable for every man; you must choose what is essential, and only a poet fits in that space.</p> <p class="noCount">Shelley also chose John for his pocket, and on what a day! Through my window I looked at the foaming river. That little yacht returning to shore, is it Ariel?</p> <p class="noCount">(<em>Imagen</em> 22–23)</p></blockquote><p> Here, we are introduced to a confluence of journalists (Cané), poets (Arrieta), politicians (Roca), musicologists and literary critics (Devoto), and Classics professors (Mascialino). These are the Argentine writers who sustained the bustling afterlife of Keats in 1950s Buenos Aires, bonded through a common physical token of recognition: walking together, carrying an “essential” edition of Keats in their pocket: “Y cuánto muchacho habrá que anda con el tomito de la <em>Everyman</em> en el bosillo, para leer a John en la calle, al aire libre, bajo los parasoles verdes de las plazas” (23). Referring to the Everyman’s Library Pocket Poets series, this notion of a “pocket Keats” establishes the poet’s universality, accessibility, and portability. Through it, Keats is available to the Latin American everyman or <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">fulano de tal</span>. It claims Keats as a working-class poet for young men living out in the world, walking and reading outdoors in town squares. He is not a bust to be worshipped upon the bookshelves of musty offices and libraries, alongside Coleridge and Eliot. Keats’s poems are a practical necessity and an item to be used daily, palpably, by this troupe of Latin American writers. Cané, Arrieta, and Devoto exist within the same chapters and street corners as “John,” in Paris, Buenos Aires, Teignmouth, and Hampstead. It is this Romantic element of timeless universality and ubiquity that appeals to Cortázar, more so than the fractured images offered by the Modernists; it lends him a space of contemporaneity and freedom. More importantly, it offers him the ability to create a unified, unbroken image, <span class="foreign" xml:lang="sp" lang="sp">una imagen de John Keats</span> that is singular and not plural.</p><p>What happens in the final lines of the passage above is jarring: in almost cinematic fashion, Cortázar draws parallels between the everyman’s daily ambles and a moment of high Romantic tragedy. Through this transition, he pans out from the pockets of the young Argentine men in 1950s to the pocket of a young Percy Shelley—drowned and washed up ashore in the Gulf of Spezia on July 8, 1822. The zooming out of the camera lens is a strategic narrative movement that affords a dramatic sense of identification between distant parties. This potential for immediate transport—physically, temporally, and historically—is seminal to Cortázar’s early writing and becomes absolutely definitive of his later works.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Critics such as Ana Martínez Santa have read <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> as a compositional training ground for Cortázar, who after the 1960s would emerge onto the world literary scene in full force (195). As we can see, Cortázar does not simply borrow themes from Keats and transplant them within a Latin American setting. Instead, <em>Imagen</em> enacts a unique experiment in flattening timescales, providing in each chapter a series of permeable wormholes through which the reader and author can embark on literary time travel, spanning from 1816 to 1959. This does not follow the model of a two-dimensional timeline but rather inhabits a three-dimensional field, an all-encompassing space that plays host to otherwise impossible interactions.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note5" id="Note5_return"><sup class="super">

       Comparative Literature 72, no. 2 (June 2020).</span></div></div> Such fluid mobility, hopping from point to point, is fundamental to Cortázar, whose experimentations with novelistic structure became his principle claim to fame. Considered by Alfred McAdam as the novel that marked the beginning of the Latin American Boom movement, <em>Hopscotch</em> (originally <em>Rayuela</em>) presents readers with an innovative set of instructions in the
        “Table of Contents”
       from which to choose different reading paths, to read sequentially or skip around in an erratic sequence (Donald Shaw,
        “Which Was the First Novel of the Boom?”
       360). The suggested trajectory for readers begins, for instance, not at Chapter 1, but Chapters “73-1-2-116-3-84-4-71...” (<em>Hopscotch</em> v). Much more than simply summon the reader to jump from section to section and experience the fluctuation of page numbers along a linear scale, Cortázar invites the reader to become immersed in jarringly different environments, transporting suddenly from a conversation with the enchanting Gekrepten in the Almagro neighborhood of Buenos Aires to a walk along the Quai de Conti in Paris with a different woman, La Maga. We can thus see how the seed of timelessness in <em>Imagen</em>, which would later explode in <em>Hopscotch</em>, also mirrored the transcontinental, back-and-forth movements between “el lado de acá” and “el lado de allá.” This penchant for dynamic movement, for a truly bodily experience of transport, fuels the “contemporaneous” intimacy that makes for the indissoluble personal bond, physically choreographed, between Cortázar and Keats.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.2"><h2><span class="head">* * *</span></h2><p><em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is a project predicated upon forging a strong individual connection between Cortázar and Keats, but it also traces lines of affinity and overlap between their literary circles. The attentive reader will easily notice parallels between the Leigh Hunt circle and the Latin American Boom writers of the 1960s and 1970s. Both consisted of young men spurred to publication in response to the political turmoil and threat of censorship during their time, the former provoked by the Peterloo Massacre, and the latter by the violence of repressive authoritarian governments and dictatorships in Latin America. The rise of military regimes in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Nicaragua, and Peru in the second half of the twentieth century ultimately brought together many Hispanic authors across Spain and Latin America. Their political fervor and leftist ideological lineage earned the Boom authors an international audience of young readers who opposed the climate of censorship and the threats to human rights, themes featured in many of the Latin American novels produced during those years.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>Cortázar left his university post at the National University of Cuyo in 1946 as a result of his opposition to the regime of General Juan Perón. In many ways, the period of censorship and intellectual repression preceding the Dirty War in Argentina became for Cortázar what Peterloo was for Keats. Nicholas Roe’s <em>Keats and the Culture of Dissent</em> and Jeffrey Cox’s <em>Poetry and Politics in the Cockney School</em> have showcased how the liberal convictions of Leigh Hunt and the Cockney School shaped Keats in a stronger vein than has been previously recognized. Much like Keats, Cortázar was sympathetic to the political urgencies shared by other Boom writers. He protested the impending presidency of Perón, leaving his teaching position and his country shortly after. He would travel to Cuba numerous times, first in 1963, but his enthusiasm for the revolution quickly dissolved when the poet Heberto Padilla was arrested and jailed by the Castro regime in 1971. Relying on his own voice, Cortázar eventually withdrew from the Cuban cause, just as Keats had eventually distanced himself from the Hunt circle, though he would always remain strongly supportive of the political left throughout his life. Still, it is important not to impose exact parallels upon the political situations of both authors, nor to assume that a Latin American author would automatically cleave to Romantic literature for its revolutionary echoes. This is simply not the case, and despite resonances between the Latin American Boom writers and the Keats-Hunt circle, <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is not a politically motivated work.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note6" id="Note6_return"><sup class="super">

For a young Cortázar to align himself with John Keats rather than a figure like James Joyce was thus a marked departure from others within his literary circle, which was dominated at the time by French intellectualism. As Peter Standish attests, Cortázar “was in many respects a romantic, the prime source of his romanticism being English poetry of the nineteenth century” (14–15). Borges, who was also a great reader of English literature, delivered a series of lectures that included twenty-five classes from <em>Beowulf</em> to <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>, with four classes devoted to Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Blake (
        “Professor Borges: A Course on English Literature”
      ). Cortázar avoids such strict chronological self-positioning: Rather than performing a historical survey, covering the breadth of the English canon, he plunged deeply into the works of a few Anglophone authors he admired, including Defoe, Poe, and Keats.</p><div class="wrapper"><p>As other articles in this <em>Praxis</em> volume show, the line of transmission from English Romanticism to Latin American writing evades the direct lines of conquest typical of transatlantic movements, such as that from Britain to colonial America and the West Indies, or from Spain to Latin America.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note7" id="Note7_return"><sup class="super">

Ramirez,
        “Keatsians in Argentina”
      ). At the same time, the English-Spanish language difference both presents an obstacle and spares them from the anxieties surrounding a colonizing language. For Cortázar, despite recognizing British literature as a central cultural force, his position on the periphery of this somewhat distant tradition is neither one of adulation nor of marginalization. So, what jagged line of influence can be traced through the lens of this cosmopolitan reader? Again, Cortázar’s model of ambulation or meandering comes to play, emulating Montaigne’s impetus to <span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr" class="foreign">essayer</span>, try out new paths, or <span xml:lang="sp" lang="sp" class="foreign">dar un paseo</span>. In 1980, he lectured to a seminar of university students in the United States: <blockquote class="quote">It has been asserted many times that Latin American literature in general enters modernity without all the baggage—and the confidence that comes with it—of a slow past and a slow evolution, as European literature has. We went from the Spanish Conquest to colonization and then independence in a stretch of time that, compared with the development of the great literary cultures of the West, is tiny, a mere instant. This means that when Latin American writers began to write, and write autonomously in each of our countries, they might have unconsciously felt the absence of a slow evolution of which they were the last link in a long chain. Suddenly they found themselves confronting a modern culture, and a language that could be used in all its expressive potential. <p class="noCount">(<em>Literature Class</em> 31)</p></blockquote> Here, in Cortázar’s assessment, Latin American authors enjoy the possibility of writing autonomously. The evolution of their literature is not a slow buildup across generations but a sudden moment in time, a “mere instant.” Its potential is thus explosive and optimistic rather than burdened by any “baggage” of periodization. Indeed, the “tiny,” “mere instant” of Latin American inspiration is not so much diminutive as it is liberating through its ahistoricity. It is important to recognize here that Cortázar’s trilingualism and worldliness afforded him the access and confidence to foray the European scene. Born in Brussels in 1914, he settled in Paris in the 1950s, traveling also to Cuba, America, Spain, and Egypt.<div class="textHoverbox"><a class="note_back" href="#Note8" id="Note8_return"><sup class="super">

His notion of the rise of Latin American literature as transpiring after the height of Western civilization is a narrative marked by indifference to the imperial burden, in fact a soaring alternative to it.</p></div><div class="wrapper"><p>Fitting this conviction that Latin American writers could burst onto the scene without feeling like “the last link in a long chain,” <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is a striking example of writing in the present, particularly from a formal perspective. This is a remarkable strategy for such a lengthy book that is able to maintain a reader’s interest without following the dramatic plotline of a novel or epic. Generically speaking, <em>Imagen</em> is not a collection of short stories, the form later favored by Cortázar and Borges; nor does it do the work of a history, mapping out a long-ranging trajectory with the poets of antiquity on one end of the timeline and contemporary writers on the other. Instead, the book is a series of moments always set in the present, invoking the mode of “automatic writing” that Cortázar and other surrealist writers would come to champion. He describes and enacts this autonomous, improvisatory process here in <em>Imagen</em>: <blockquote class="quote"><p class="noCount">Years ago I had renounced thinking in any coherent way; my Waterman ink pen thinks better for me.

This confidence in seizing the present and shrugging off the past is professedly a tactic he learned from and shared with Keats. Just as Cortázar does not owe his inspiration to Keats, Keats is not beholden to his predecessors. Neither feels the weight of the English canon upon him. Cortázar explains: <blockquote class="quote"><div class="wrapper"><p>This is how Keats always felt, and if it is literally impossible to say that he cleared the slate of the past, we will see that his adherence to this past is neither born out of a nostalgia nor a sentiment of reverence in the Manriquean mode. On the contrary, in his own poetic dimension, he lives so deeply in the past that he does not feel the need to profess about it, and this abolishes divisions of chronology. From 1814 to 1816, he was trapped by the magic of Spenser’s <em>The Faerie Queene</em>. Later on, it is Shakespeare and Milton who enchant him. But can we really speak about the past—in the sense that Ortega understands it—when we are talking about Shakespeare and Milton <em>in</em> England? When Keats feels the need to escape Spenser’s charms—and that was truly a temporal contemplation of a long-gone past—, John remains squarely within the same temporal dimension of Milton and, above all, of Shakespeare. They are not “models or norms”: they are the poetry at the level that Keats is striving so willfully to reach. In regards to Greece, where he finds all the imagery of <em>Endymion</em>, all the pathos of <em>Lamia</em>, and the instant purity of
        “Ode on a Grecian Urn,”
       his talent is not that of a historian. For John, his world of Hampstead and Greece are the very same reality where nature and man coexist in an alternate plane of direct contemplation and mythological symbology. He does not feel the nostalgia of Greece; his overwhelming joy weaves the tapestry of pagan images in his poetry. He does not see any reason to deplore the passing of time. The <em>eternal</em> world is within reach of his hand, and what his eyes see in an oak tree is the same thing that Virgil saw.

        “Circumstance and Choice,”
       celebrates Keats’s creative autonomy despite being informed by Milton, Shakespeare, and Virgil. In this shared reality, Hampstead is Greece; Keats sees the very same oak tree that Virgil saw. Any literary resemblances are not a matter of historical eventuality but of taste and happenstance of the present. In turn, Cortázar clears his own “slate of the past,” “abolishes the divisions of chronology,” and can draw on Keats without “nostalgia nor a sentiment of reverence.” This lends him, too, complete autonomy from any anxiety of historical influence, within or across national traditions.

These include selected stanzas of Keats’s poems translated by Cortázar himself, as well as lines of Baudelaire, Rimbaud (referred to as “Rimbe”), Mallarmé (“Stéphane”), Shelley, and occasionally, a rare poem or two of Cortázar’s own, inspired by Keats. Combining poetic elements with novelistic structures and components of the short story, Cortázar recruits historical figures but avoids a linear fictional plotline, placing them instead within an amorphous formal space—a space that bridges all three genres, and where time and setting are collapsed.</p><p>Establishing poets as the ultimate measurers of time, Cortázar operates in the capacity of a vatic poet envisioning not just the future but an ever-mysterious present: </p><blockquote class="quote"><p class="noCount">Born on ______ Died on ______</p> <p class="noCount">Nonsense.</p> <p class="noCount">As Giri says about his mother in

In this poetic world in which there are neither birth dates nor death dates,
        “Julio y John”
       take turns leading one another. At the beginning of this article, Cortázar invited Keats for a stroll, placing him in his pocket. Here, he again initiates, but agrees to follow. We see Cortázar inverting the neoromantic impetus of a 1950s writer wishing he lived in the 1810s. Instead, he claims Keats as contemporary, emphasizing both the portability of a pocket Keats and the transportability of all authors into one another’s worlds. This poses a new kind of relationship between British Romanticism and Latin American postmodernist writing, one based on two Cortazarian models: “hopscotch,” which allows us to jump discreetly from point to point within a field that precludes strict sequencing; and “blow-up,” the zooming in up close to a single image, uncovering new life, movement, and action as in a film before panning out. Cortázar shows that the “time traveling” of <em>Hopscotch</em> and up-close reading experiences of
        “Blow-up”
       are not learned <em>from</em> Keats, but <em>with</em> him, as they go forward together, collapsing distance, overlapping time scales, and merging genres.</p><p>From the beginning to the end of a long work that never truly feels sequential in its narrative, Cortázar cultivates a purposeful simultaneity and universality that allows him to commune eternally with Keats. Indeed, throughout <em>Imagen</em>, time overlaps on various levels: in the metric time of poetry, the historical timelines of biography, and the narrative horizontal direction of chapters progressing within a novel. Genres overlap as we see the novel and short story overlaid upon the smaller poetic building blocks of alliteration, metaphor, and anaphora. Ultimately, a thoughtful reading of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> is not an exercise in noticing the many parallels between two worlds, two times, and three genres; nor is it simply an occasion to trace lines of inheritance. Rather, it is recognizing the vision of a lively constellation within a single shared space of three-dimensionality, a dynamic collage that choreographs participation in a shared “reality.”</p><p>Cortázar’s book depicts the accessibility of the “everyman” Keats for all readers, inclusive of a Latin American and Hispanophone audience, from the 1950s to today. His games of “hopscotch” and “blow-up” depict a dynamic image of Keats not otherwise afforded to us in chronological memoirs, biography, or literary criticism. And while this formal ambiguity may have been the very reason for the omission of <em>Imagen de John Keats</em> from Keats’s critical lineage thus far, it is a work to be rediscovered and honored—to be preciously placed in our pockets—as a model that resists traditional patterns of Latin American afterlives through its insistent contemporaneity.</p></div><div class="citation" id="index.xml-body.1_div.1_div.5"><h2><span class="head">Works Cited</span></h2><div class="biblfree">Almeida, Joselyn M. <em>Reimagining the Transatlantic, 1780–1790</em>.

A movie has an open order, a detailed and rounded structure in which many frames or puzzle pieces eventually deliver a finished story to the viewer, as in a novel. A photograph, on the other hand, presupposes limitations. It is one immobile frame of a single significant piece to a puzzle, a fragment of reality to which the viewer must supply the remaining pieces, as in a short story. The short story, therefore, is an ‘opening up’ of a reality that is much greater than that of the actual tale: ‘that fabulous opening of the minute onto the gigantic, of that which is individual and circumscribed onto the very essence of the human condition.’” (Picon Garfield 13)</span><a class="note_back" title="Go back to text" href="#Note13_return"><em>  [back]</em></a></div></div></body></html>
